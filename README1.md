LIC New Jeevan Shanti - RAG System

This repository contains a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline built to extract and synthesize information from the LIC New Jeevan Shanti policy document. The system explores the use of multiple embedding models and large language models (LLMs) to evaluate their performance during indexing and response generation stages.

ðŸ“Œ Objectives

Parse and load the LIC New Jeevan Shanti PDF document using LlamaParser.
Index content using a vector store.
Experiment with different embedding models.
Compare synthesis quality using multiple LLMs.
Evaluate system performance across configurations.
