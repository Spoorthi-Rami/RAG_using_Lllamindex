However, the absence of these words or similar expressions does not mean that a \\nstatement is not forward-looking. All statements that address operating performance, events or developments that we expect or \\nanticipate will occur in the future — including statements relating to volume growth, share of sales and net income per share \\ngrowth, and statements expressing general views about future operating results — are forward-looking statements. \\nManagement believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made. However, caution should be \\ntaken not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements because such statements speak only as of the date \\nwhen made. Our Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a \\nresult of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. In addition, forward-looking statements are \\nsubject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our Company’s actual results to differ materially from historical \\nexperience and our present expectations or projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the \\npossibility that the assumptions used to calculate our estimated aggregate incremental tax and interest liability related to the \\npotential unfavorable outcome of the ongoing tax dispute with the United States Internal Revenue Service could significantly \\nchange; those described in Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this report; and those described from time to time \\nin our future reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\\nPart I\\nITEM 1.  BUSINESS\\nIn this report, the terms “The Coca-Cola Company,” “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” mean The Coca-Cola Company and all \\nentities included in our consolidated financial statements.\\nGeneral\\nThe Coca-Cola Company is a total beverage company, and beverage products bearing our trademarks, sold in the United States \\nsince 1886, are now sold in more than 200 countries and territories. We own or license and market numerous beverage brands, \\nwhich we group into the following categories: Trademark Coca-Cola; sparkling flavors; water, sports, coffee and tea; juice, \\nvalue-added dairy and plant-based beverages; and emerging beverages. We own and market several of the world’s largest \\nnonalcoholic sparkling soft drink brands, including Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and Diet Coke/Coca-Cola \\nLight. \\nWe make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of independent \\nbottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and retailers as well as our consolidated bottling and distribution operations. \\nBeverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to the Company account for 2.2 billion of the estimated 64 billion servings \\nof all beverages consumed worldwide every day.\\nWe believe our success depends on our ability to connect with consumers by providing them with a wide variety of beverage \\noptions to meet their desires, needs and lifestyles. Our success further depends on the ability of our people to execute \\neffectively, every day.\\nWe are guided by our purpose, which is to refresh the world and make a difference. Our vision for growth has three connected \\npillars:\\n• Loved Brands. We craft meaningful brands and a choice of drinks that people love and enjoy and that refresh them in \\nbody and spirit.\\n• Done Sustainably. We grow our business in ways that achieve positive change in the world and build a more sustainable \\nfuture for our planet.\\n• For a Better Shared Future. We invest to improve people’s lives, from our employees to all those who touch our business \\nsystem, to our investors, to the communities we call home.\\nThe Coca-Cola Company was incorporated in September 1919 under the laws of the State of Delaware and succeeded to the \\nbusiness of a Georgia corporation with the same name that had been organized in 1892.\\n2\\nOperating Segments\\nThe Company’s operating structure is the basis for our internal financial reporting. Our operating structure includes the \\nfollowing operating segments:\\n• Europe, Middle East and Africa\\n• Latin America\\n• North America\\n• Asia Pacific\\n• Global Ventures\\n• Bottling Investments\\nAdditionally, our operating structure includes operating units, which sit under our four geographic operating segments. The \\noperating units are focused on regional and local execution and are highly interconnected, with the goal of eliminating \\nduplication of resources and scaling new products more quickly. The operating units work closely with five global marketing \\ncategory leadership teams to rapidly scale ideas while staying close to the consumer. The global marketing category leadership \\nteams primarily focus on innovation as well as marketing efficiency and effectiveness. \\nOur operating structure also includes Corporate, which consists of two components: (1) a center focusing on strategic \\ninitiatives, policy, governance and scaling global initiatives, and (2) a platform services organization supporting the operating \\nunits, global marketing category leadership teams and the center by providing efficient and scaled global services and \\ncapabilities, including, but not limited to, transactional work, data management, consumer analytics, digital commerce and \\nsocial/digital hubs. \\nFor additional information about our operating segments and Corporate, refer to Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial \\nStatements set forth in Part II, “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report.\\nExcept to the extent that differences among operating segments are material to an understanding of our business taken as a \\nwhole, the description of our business in this report is presented on a consolidated basis.\\nProducts and Brands\\nAs used in this report:\\n• “concentrates” means flavorings and other ingredients which, when combined with water and, depending on the product, \\nsweeteners (nutritive or non-nutritive) are used to prepare syrups or finished beverages, and includes powders/minerals \\nfor purified water products;\\n• “syrups” means intermediate products in the beverage manufacturing process produced by combining concentrates with \\nwater and, depending on the product, sweeteners (nutritive or non-nutritive);\\n• “fountain syrups” means syrups that are sold to fountain retailers, such as restaurants and convenience stores, which use \\ndispensing equipment to mix the syrups with sparkling or still water at the time of purchase to produce finished \\nbeverages that are served in cups or glasses for immediate consumption;\\n• “Company Trademark Beverages” means beverages bearing our trademarks and certain other beverages bearing \\ntrademarks licensed to us by third parties for which we provide marketing support and from the sale of which we derive \\nan economic benefit; and\\n• “Trademark Coca-Cola Beverages” or “Trademark Coca-Cola” means nonalcoholic beverages bearing the trademark \\nCoca-Cola or any trademark that includes Coca-Cola or Coke (that is, Coca-Cola, Diet Coke/Coca-Cola Light and   \\nCoca-Cola Zero Sugar and all their variations and any line extensions, including caffeine free Diet Coke, Cherry Coke, \\netc.). Likewise, when we use the capitalized word “Trademark” together with the name of one of our other beverage \\nproducts (such as “Trademark Fanta,” “Trademark Sprite” or “Trademark Simply”), we mean nonalcoholic beverages \\nbearing the indicated trademark (that is, Fanta, Sprite or Simply, respectively) and all its variations and line extensions \\n(such that “Trademark Fanta” includes Fanta Orange, Fanta Zero Orange, Fanta Zero Sugar, Fanta Apple, etc.; \\n“Trademark Sprite” includes Sprite, Sprite Zero Sugar, etc.; and “Trademark Simply” includes Simply Orange, Simply \\nApple, Simply Grapefruit, etc.).\\nOur Company operates in two lines of business: concentrate operations and finished product operations.\\nOur concentrate operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as \\n“beverage bases,” syrups, including fountain syrups, and certain finished beverages to authorized bottling operations (to which \\nwe typically refer as our “bottlers” or our “bottling partners”). Our bottling partners either combine concentrates with still or \\n3\\nsparkling water and sweeteners (depending on the product), or combine syrups with still or sparkling water, to produce finished \\nbeverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers, such as cans and refillable and nonrefillable glass and \\nplastic bottles, bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, \\nthrough wholesalers or other bottlers. In addition, outside the United States, our bottling partners are typically authorized to \\nmanufacture fountain syrups, using our concentrates, which they sell to fountain retailers for use in producing beverages for \\nimmediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain \\nretailers. Our concentrate operations are included in our geographic operating segments and our Global Ventures operating \\nsegment.\\nOur finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling soft drinks and a variety of other finished \\nbeverages to retailers, or to distributors and wholesalers who in turn sell the beverages to retailers. Generally, finished product \\noperations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations. These operations \\nconsist primarily of our consolidated bottling and distribution operations, which are included in our Bottling Investments \\noperating segment. In certain markets, the Company also operates non-bottling finished product operations in which we sell \\nfinished beverages to distributors and wholesalers that are generally not one of the Company’s bottling partners. These \\noperations are generally included in one of our geographic operating segments or our Global Ventures operating segment. \\nAdditionally, we sell directly to consumers through retail stores operated by Costa Limited (“Costa”). These sales are included \\nin our Global Ventures operating segment. In the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain \\nretailers, who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers \\nor bottling partners who in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. These fountain syrup sales are \\nincluded in our North America operating segment. \\nFor information regarding net operating revenues and unit case volume related to our concentrate operations and finished \\nproduct operations, refer to the heading “Our Business — General” set forth in Part II, “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and \\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this report.\\nFor information regarding how we measure the volume of Company beverage products sold by the Company and our bottling \\npartners (“Coca-Cola system”), refer to the heading “Operations Review — Beverage Volume” set forth in Part II, “Item 7. \\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this report.\\nWe own and market numerous valuable beverage brands, including the following:\\n• sparkling soft drinks: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke/Coca-Cola Light, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, Fanta, Fresca, Schweppes1, Sprite \\nand Thums Up;\\n• water, sports, coffee and tea: Aquarius, Ayataka, BODYARMOR, Ciel, Costa, Dasani, doğadan, FUZE TEA, Georgia, \\nglacéau smartwater, glacéau vitaminwater, Gold Peak, Ice Dew, I LOHAS, Powerade and Topo Chico; and \\n• juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages: AdeS, Del Valle, fairlife, innocent, Minute Maid, Minute Maid \\nPulpy and Simply. \\n1 Schweppes is owned by the Company in certain countries other than the United States.\\nThe Company has also directly entered the alcohol beverage category in numerous markets outside the United States. In the \\nUnited States, the Company has established a wholly owned, indirect, firewalled subsidiary, which authorizes alcohol-licensed \\nthird parties to use certain of our trademarks and related intellectual property on alcohol beverages that contain Company \\nbeverage bases. The Company’s approach in alcohol focuses on three segments of alcohol ready-to-drink beverages: hard \\nseltzers (e.g., Topo Chico Hard Seltzer), hard alternatives (e.g., Lemon-Dou) and pre-mixed cocktails (e.g., Jack Daniel’s &           \\nCoca-Cola). \\nIn addition to the beverage brands we own, we also provide marketing support and otherwise participate in the sales of other \\nbeverage brands through licenses, joint ventures and strategic relationships. For example, certain Coca-Cola system bottlers \\ndistribute certain brands of Monster Beverage Corporation (“Monster”), primarily Monster Energy, in designated territories in \\nthe United States, Canada and other international territories pursuant to distribution coordination agreements between the \\nCompany and Monster and related distribution agreements between Monster and Coca-Cola system bottlers.\\nConsumer demand determines the optimal menu of Company product offerings. Consumer demand can vary from one market \\nto another and can change over time within a single market. Our Company continually seeks to further optimize its portfolio of \\nbrands, products and services in order to create and satisfy consumer demand in every market.\\nDistribution System\\nWe make our branded beverage products available to consumers in more than 200 countries and territories through our network \\nof independent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and retailers as well as our consolidated bottling and distribution \\noperations. Consumers enjoy finished beverage products bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to the Company at a rate of \\n4\\n2.2 billion servings each day. Our strong and stable bottling and distribution system helps us capture growth by manufacturing, \\ndistributing and selling existing, enhanced and new innovative products to consumers throughout the world.\\nThe Coca-Cola system sold 33.3 billion and 32.7 billion unit cases of our products in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Sparkling \\nsoft drinks represented 69% of our worldwide unit case volume in both 2023 and 2022. Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for \\n47% and 46% of our worldwide unit case volume in 2023 and 2022, respectively. In 2023, unit case volume in the United \\nStates represented 16% of the Company’s worldwide unit case volume. Of the U.S. unit case volume, 61% was attributable to \\nsparkling soft drinks. Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 42% of U.S. unit case volume. Unit case volume outside the United \\nStates represented 84% of the Company’s worldwide unit case volume in 2023. The countries outside the United States in \\nwhich our unit case volumes were the largest were Mexico, China, Brazil and India, which together accounted for 33% of our \\nworldwide unit case volume. Of the non-U.S. unit case volume, 70% was attributable to sparkling soft drinks. Trademark  \\nCoca-Cola accounted for 48% of non-U.S. unit case volume.\\nOur five largest independent bottling partners based on unit case volume in 2023 were as follows:\\n• Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. (“Coca-Cola FEMSA”), which has bottling and distribution operations in Mexico (a \\nsubstantial part of central Mexico, as well as southeast and northeast Mexico), Guatemala, Colombia (most of the \\ncountry), Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Venezuela, Uruguay, Brazil (a major part of the states of São Paulo and Minas \\nGerais; the states of Mato Grosso do Sul, Paraná, Rio Grande do Sul, and Santa Catarina; and part of the states of Goiás \\nand Rio de Janeiro), and Argentina (federal capital of Buenos Aires and surrounding areas); \\n• Coca-Cola Europacific Partners plc (“CCEP”), which has bottling and distribution operations in Andorra, Australia, \\nBelgium, Fiji, continental France, Germany, Great Britain, Iceland, Indonesia, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, \\nNew Zealand, Norway, Papua New Guinea, Portugal, Samoa, Spain and Sweden; \\n• Coca-Cola HBC AG (“Coca-Cola Hellenic”), which has bottling and distribution operations in Armenia, Austria, \\nBelarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Egypt, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, \\nItaly, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Montenegro, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland, Poland, Republic of \\nIreland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Ukraine;\\n• Arca Continental, S.A.B. de C.V., which has bottling and distribution operations in northern and western Mexico, \\nnorthern Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, and the state of Texas and part of the states of New Mexico, Oklahoma and Arkansas \\nin the United States; and\\n• Swire Coca-Cola Limited, which has bottling and distribution operations in 11 provinces and the Shanghai municipality \\nin mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Cambodia, Vietnam and territories in 13 states in the western United States.  \\nIn 2023, these five bottling partners combined represented 42% of our total worldwide unit case volume.\\nBeing a bottler does not create a legal partnership or joint venture between us and our bottlers. Our bottlers are independent \\ncontractors and are not our agents.\\nBottler’s Agreements\\nWe have separate contracts, to which we generally refer as “bottler’s agreements,” with our bottling partners under which our \\nbottling partners are granted certain authorizations by us. Subject to specified terms and conditions and certain variations, the \\nbottler’s agreements generally authorize the bottlers to prepare, package, distribute and sell Company Trademark Beverages in \\nauthorized containers in (but, subject to applicable local law, generally only in) an identified territory. The bottler is obligated to \\npurchase its entire requirement of concentrates or syrups for the designated Company Trademark Beverages from the Company \\nor Company-authorized suppliers. We typically agree to refrain from selling or distributing, or from authorizing third parties to \\nsell or distribute, the designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the particular authorized \\ncontainers. However, we typically reserve for us or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark \\nBeverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such \\nCompany Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some \\ncases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\\nWhile under most of our bottler’s agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of \\nsale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company’s ability to exercise its contractual \\nflexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the \\nUnited States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow \\ntogether through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers’ always changing \\nneeds and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the \\nconcentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in \\nwhich the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix. \\n5\\nAs further discussed below, our bottler’s agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our \\nbottler’s agreements for territories within the United States. \\nBottler’s Agreements Outside the United States\\nBottler’s agreements between us and our authorized bottlers outside the United States generally are of stated duration, subject in \\nsome cases to possible extensions or renewals. Generally, these bottler’s agreements are subject to termination by the Company \\nfollowing the occurrence of certain designated events, including defined events of default and certain changes in ownership or \\ncontrol of the bottlers. Most of the bottler’s agreements in force between us and bottlers outside the United States authorize the \\nbottlers to manufacture and distribute fountain syrups, usually on a nonexclusive basis.\\nIn certain parts of the world outside the United States, we have not granted comprehensive beverage production and distribution \\nrights to the bottlers. In such instances, we have authorized certain bottlers to (1) prepare and package Company Trademark \\nBeverages for sale to other bottlers or (2) purchase Company Trademark Beverages from other bottlers for sale and distribution \\nthroughout their respective designated territories, often on a nonexclusive basis.\\nBottler’s Agreements Within the United States\\nIn the United States, most bottlers operate under a contract to which we generally refer as a “Comprehensive Beverage \\nAgreement” (“CBA”) that is of stated duration, subject in most cases to renewal rights of bottlers and in some cases to renewal \\nrights of the Company. A small number of bottlers continue to operate under legacy bottler’s agreements with no stated \\nexpiration date for Trademark Coca-Cola Beverages and other cola-flavored Company Trademark Beverages. In all instances, \\nthe bottler’s agreements in the United States are subject to termination by the Company for nonperformance or upon the \\noccurrence of certain defined events of default that may vary from contract to contract.\\nCertain U.S. bottlers have been granted certain additional exclusive territory rights for the distribution, promotion, marketing \\nand sale of Company-owned and licensed beverage brands (as defined by the CBAs). We refer to these bottlers as “expanding \\nparticipating bottlers” or “EPBs.” EPBs operate under CBAs (“EPB CBAs”) under which the Company generally retained the \\nrights to produce the applicable beverage products for territories not covered by specific manufacturing agreements, and such \\nbottlers purchase from the Company (or from Company-authorized manufacturing bottlers) substantially all of the finished \\nbeverage products needed in order to service the customers in these territories. Each EPB CBA has a term of 10 years and is \\nrenewable, in most cases by the bottler, and in some cases by the Company, indefinitely for successive additional terms of      \\n10 years each and includes additional requirements that provide for, among other things, a binding national governance model, \\nmandatory incidence pricing and certain core performance requirements. The Company has also entered into manufacturing \\nagreements that authorize certain EPBs that have executed EPB CBAs to manufacture certain beverage products for their own \\naccount and for supply to other bottlers. \\nIn addition, certain U.S. bottlers that were not granted additional exclusive territory rights, which we refer to as “participating \\nbottlers,” converted their legacy bottler’s agreements to CBAs, to which we refer as “participating bottler CBAs,” each of \\nwhich has a term of 10 years, is renewable by the bottler indefinitely for successive additional terms of 10 years each, and is \\nsubstantially similar in most material respects to the EPB CBAs, including with respect to requirements for a binding national \\ngovernance model and mandatory incidence pricing, but includes core performance requirements that vary in certain respects \\nfrom those in the EPB CBAs.\\nThose bottlers that have not signed CBAs continue to operate under legacy bottler’s agreements that include pricing formulas \\nthat generally provide for a baseline price for Trademark Coca-Cola Beverages and other cola-flavored Company Trademark \\nBeverages. This baseline price may be adjusted periodically by the Company, up to a maximum indexed ceiling price, and is \\nadjusted quarterly based upon changes in certain sugar or sweetener prices, as applicable. The U.S. unit case volume prepared, \\npackaged, sold and distributed under these legacy bottler’s agreements is not material.\\nUnder the terms of the bottler’s agreements, bottlers in the United States generally are not authorized to manufacture fountain \\nsyrups. Rather, the Company manufactures and sells fountain syrups to authorized fountain wholesalers (including certain \\nauthorized bottlers) and some fountain retailers. These wholesalers in turn sell the syrups, or deliver them on our behalf, to \\nrestaurants and other retailers.\\nPromotional and Marketing Programs\\nIn addition to conducting our own independent advertising and marketing activities, we may provide promotional and \\nmarketing support and/or funds to our bottlers. In most cases, we do this on a discretionary basis under the terms of \\ncommitment letters or agreements, even though we are not obligated to do so under the terms of the bottler’s agreements \\nbetween our Company and the bottlers. Also, on a discretionary basis in most cases, our Company may develop and introduce \\nnew products, packages and equipment to assist the bottlers. Likewise, in many instances, we provide promotional and \\nmarketing support and/or funds and/or dispensing equipment and repair services to fountain and bottle/can retailers, typically \\npursuant to marketing agreements. \\n6\\nInvestments in Bottling Operations\\nMost of our branded beverage products are prepared, packaged, distributed and sold by independent bottling partners. However, \\nfrom time to time we acquire or take control of a bottling operation, often in underperforming markets where we believe we can \\nuse our resources and expertise to improve performance. Owning a bottling operation enables us to compensate for limited local \\nresources; help focus the bottler’s sales and marketing programs; assist in the development of the bottler’s business and \\ninformation systems; and establish an appropriate capital structure for the bottler. In line with our long-term bottling strategy, \\nwe may periodically consider options for divesting or reducing our ownership interest in a consolidated bottling operation, \\ntypically by selling all or a portion of our interest in the bottling operation to an independent bottler to improve Coca-Cola \\nsystem efficiency. When we sell a consolidated bottling operation to an independent bottling partner in which we have an \\nequity method investment, our Company continues to participate in the bottler’s results of operations through our share of the \\nequity method investee’s earnings or losses.\\nIn addition, from time to time we make equity investments representing noncontrolling interests in certain bottling operations \\nwith the intention of maximizing the strength and efficiency of the Coca-Cola system’s production, marketing, sales and \\ndistribution capabilities around the world by providing expertise and resources to strengthen those businesses. These \\ninvestments are intended to result in increases in unit case volume, net operating revenues and profits at the bottler level, which \\nin turn generate increased sales for our Company’s concentrate operations. When our equity investment provides us with the \\nability to exercise significant influence over the investee bottler’s operating and financial policies, we account for the \\ninvestment under the equity method.\\nSeasonality\\nSales of our ready-to-drink beverages are somewhat seasonal, with the second and third calendar quarters historically \\naccounting for the highest sales volumes. The volume of sales in the beverage business may be affected by weather conditions.\\nCompetition\\nThe commercial beverage industry is highly competitive and consists of numerous companies, ranging from small or emerging \\nto very large and well established. These include companies that, like our Company, compete globally in multiple geographic \\nareas, as well as businesses that are primarily regional or local in operation. Competitive products include numerous \\nnonalcoholic sparkling soft drinks; water products, including flavored and enhanced waters; juices, juice drinks and nectars; \\ndilutables (including syrups and powders); coffees; teas; energy drinks; sports drinks; milk and other dairy-based drinks; plant-\\nbased beverages; functional beverages, including vitamin-based products and relaxation beverages; and various other \\nnonalcoholic beverages. These competitive products are sold to consumers in both ready-to-drink and non-ready-to-drink form. \\nThe Company has directly entered the alcohol beverage category in numerous markets outside the United States. In the United \\nStates, the Company has established a wholly owned, indirect, firewalled subsidiary, which authorizes alcohol-licensed third \\nparties to use certain of our trademarks and related intellectual property on alcohol beverages that contain Company beverage \\nbases. Competitive products include all alcohol ready-to-drink beverages containing various alcohol bases. In many of the \\ncountries in which we do business, PepsiCo, Inc. is a primary competitor. Other significant competitors include, but are not \\nlimited to, Nestlé S.A., Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., Danone S.A., Suntory Beverage & Food Limited, AB InBev, Kirin Holdings, \\nHeineken N.V., Diageo and Red Bull GmbH. We also compete against numerous regional and local companies and, \\nincreasingly, against smaller companies that are developing microbrands and selling them directly to consumers through e-\\ncommerce retailers and other e-commerce platforms. In addition, in some markets, we compete against retailers that have \\ndeveloped their own store or private-label beverage brands.\\nCompetitive factors impacting our business include, but are not limited to, pricing, advertising, sales promotion programs,  \\nin-store displays and point-of-sale marketing, digital marketing, product and ingredient innovation, increased efficiency in \\nproduction techniques, the introduction of new packaging as well as new vending and dispensing equipment, contracting with \\nmarketing assets (theaters, sports arenas, universities, etc.), and brand and trademark development and protection.\\nOur competitive strengths include leading brands with high levels of consumer recognition and loyalty; a worldwide network of \\nbottlers and distributors of Company products; sophisticated marketing capabilities; and a talented group of dedicated \\nemployees. Our competitive challenges include strong competitors in all geographic regions; in many countries, a concentrated \\nretail sector with powerful buyers able to freely choose among Company products, products of competitive beverage suppliers \\nand individual retailers’ own store or private-label beverage brands; new industry entrants; and dramatic shifts in consumer \\nshopping methods and patterns due to a rapidly evolving digital landscape.\\nRaw Materials\\nWe and our bottling partners use various ingredients in our business, including high fructose corn syrup (“HFCS”), sucrose, \\naspartame, acesulfame potassium, sucralose, saccharin, cyclamate, steviol glycosides, ascorbic acid, citric acid, phosphoric \\nacid, caffeine and caramel color; other raw materials such as orange and other fruit juice and juice concentrates, milk, and \\n7\\ncoffee; packaging materials such as polyethylene terephthalate (“PET”), bio-based PET and recycled PET for bottles; and \\naluminum cans, glass bottles and other containers. \\nWater is a main ingredient in substantially all of our products. While historically we have not experienced significant water \\nsupply difficulties, water is a limited natural resource in many parts of the world, and our Company recognizes water \\navailability, quality and sustainability, for both our operations and also the communities where we operate, as one of the key \\nchallenges facing our business.\\nIn addition to water, the principal raw materials used in our business are nutritive and non-nutritive sweeteners. In the United \\nStates, the principal nutritive sweetener is HFCS, which is nutritionally equivalent to sugar. HFCS is available from numerous \\ndomestic sources and has historically been subject to fluctuations in its market price. Adverse weather conditions may affect the \\nsupply of agricultural commodities from which key ingredients for our products are derived. For example, drought conditions in \\ncertain parts of the United States or in other major corn-producing areas of the world may negatively affect the supply of corn, \\nwhich in turn may result in shortages of and higher prices for HFCS. The principal nutritive sweetener used by our business \\noutside the United States is sucrose (i.e., table sugar), which is also available from numerous sources and has historically been \\nsubject to fluctuations in its market price. Our Company generally has not experienced any difficulties in obtaining its \\nrequirements for nutritive sweeteners. In the United States, we purchase HFCS to meet our and our bottlers’ requirements with \\nthe assistance of Coca-Cola Bottlers’ Sales & Services Company LLC (“CCBSS”). CCBSS is a limited liability company that is \\nowned by authorized Coca-Cola bottlers doing business in the United States and Canada. Among other things, CCBSS provides \\nprocurement services to our North American operations and to our U.S. and Canadian bottling partners for the purchase of \\nvarious goods and services, including HFCS.\\nThe principal non-nutritive sweeteners we use in our business are aspartame, acesulfame potassium, sucralose, saccharin, \\ncyclamate and steviol glycosides. Generally, these raw materials are readily available from numerous sources. We purchase \\nsucralose, which we consider a critical raw material, from suppliers in the United States and China. Our Company generally has \\nnot experienced major difficulties in obtaining its requirements for non-nutritive sweeteners. \\nJuice and juice concentrate from various fruits, particularly orange juice and orange juice concentrate, are the principal raw \\nmaterials for our juice and juice drink products. We source our orange juice and orange juice concentrate primarily from Florida \\nand the Southern Hemisphere (particularly Brazil). We work closely with Cutrale Citrus Juices U.S.A., Inc., our primary \\nsupplier of orange juice from Florida and Brazil, to ensure an adequate supply of orange juice and orange juice concentrate that \\nmeets our Company’s standards. However, the citrus industry is impacted by citrus greening disease and the variability of \\nweather conditions that can affect the quality and supply of orange juice and orange juice concentrate. In particular, freezing \\nweather or hurricanes in central Florida may result in shortages and higher prices for orange juice and orange juice concentrate \\nthroughout the industry. In addition, citrus greening disease is reducing the number of citrus trees and increasing grower costs \\nand prices.\\nMilk is the principal raw material for our dairy products. We derive the majority of our dairy revenues through fairlife, LLC \\n(“fairlife”), which purchases milk from dairy cooperatives that in turn source milk from farms within the cooperatives. While \\nour sourcing for milk is currently concentrated among a few dairy cooperatives, we believe we have access to alternate \\nsuppliers, if necessary, to help ensure an adequate supply of milk.\\nWe generate most of our coffee revenues through Costa. Costa purchases Rainforest Alliance Certified and other green coffee \\nthrough multiple suppliers. While most of Costa’s coffee is sourced as readily available bulked commercial grade from Brazil, \\nVietnam and Colombia, many of Costa’s suppliers have vertically integrated supply chains with direct access to yields from \\ncooperatives and producer groups.\\nOur consolidated bottling operations and our non-bottling finished product operations also purchase various other raw \\nmaterials, including, but not limited to, PET resin, preforms and bottles; glass and aluminum bottles; aluminum and steel cans; \\nplastic closures; aseptic fiber packaging; labels; cartons; cases; postmix packaging; and beverage gases, including carbon \\ndioxide and liquid nitrogen. While we generally purchase these raw materials from multiple suppliers and historically have not \\nexperienced significant shortages, certain packaging materials, such as aluminum cans, are available from a limited number of \\nsuppliers. \\nPatents, Copyrights, Trade Secrets and Trademarks\\nOur Company owns numerous patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other know-how and technology, which we collectively \\nrefer to as “technology.” This technology generally relates to beverage products and the processes for their production; \\npackages and packaging materials; design and operation of processes and equipment useful for our business; and certain \\nsoftware. Some of the technology is licensed to suppliers and other parties. Trade secrets are an important aspect of our \\ntechnology, and our sparkling beverage and other beverage formulas are among the important trade secrets of our Company.\\nWe also own numerous trademarks that are very important to our business. Depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are \\nvalid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained. Pursuant to our bottler’s agreements, we \\n8\\nauthorize our bottlers to use applicable Company trademarks in connection with their preparation, packaging, distribution and \\nsale of Company products. In addition, we authorize certain third parties to use applicable Company trademarks in connection \\nwith their preparation, packaging, distribution and sale of beverages bearing Company trademarks in certain territories. We also \\ngrant licenses to third parties from time to time to use certain of our trademarks in conjunction with certain merchandise and \\nfood products. \\nGovernmental Regulation\\nOur Company is required to comply, and it is our policy to comply, with all applicable laws in the countries and territories \\nthroughout the world in which we do business. In many jurisdictions, our operations may come under special scrutiny by \\ncompetition law authorities due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions.\\nIn the United States, the safety, production, storage, transportation, distribution, advertising, marketing, labeling and sale of our \\nCompany’s products and their ingredients are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; the Federal Trade \\nCommission Act; the Lanham Act; state consumer protection laws; various federal and state laws and regulations governing \\ncompetition and trade practices, including the Robinson-Patman Act of 1936, as amended, and the Clayton Antitrust Act of \\n1914, as amended; federal, state and local workplace health and safety laws; various federal and state laws and regulations \\ngoverning our employment practices, including those related to equal employment opportunity and compensation; various \\nfederal, state and local environmental protection laws; privacy and personal data protection laws; and various other federal, \\nstate and local statutes and regulations. We are also required to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Trade \\nSanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act. Outside the United States, our business is subject to numerous similar statutes \\nand regulations, as well as other legal and regulatory requirements and regulatory reviews.\\nVarious jurisdictions have adopted, and may seek to adopt, significant additional product labeling or warning requirements or \\nlimitations on the marketing or sale of our products because of what they contain or allegations that they cause adverse health \\neffects. If these types of requirements become applicable to one or more of our products under current or future environmental \\nor health laws or regulations, they may inhibit sales of such products or make it necessary for us to reformulate certain of our \\nproducts. Under the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (“Proposition 65”) of the state of California, if \\nthe state has determined that a substance causes cancer or harms human reproduction or development, a warning must be \\nprovided for any product sold in the state that exposes consumers to that substance, unless the conditions of an exemption \\n(described below) can be met. The state maintains lists of these substances and periodically adds other substances to these lists. \\nThe detection of even a trace amount of a listed substance can subject an affected product to the requirement of a warning label. \\nHowever, Proposition 65 exempts a product from a warning if the manufacturer can demonstrate that the use of that product \\nexposes consumers to a daily quantity of a listed substance that is:\\n• below a “safe harbor” threshold that may be established;\\n• naturally occurring;\\n• the result of necessary cooking; or\\n• subject to another applicable exemption.\\nOne or more substances that are currently on the Proposition 65 list can be detected in certain Company products at low levels \\nthat are safe. The Company maintains that the presence of each such substance in Company products is subject to an applicable \\nexemption from the warning requirement or that the product is otherwise in compliance with Proposition 65. However, the state \\nof California and other parties have in the past taken a contrary position and may do so in the future. Additionally, the state of \\nCalifornia may include other substances on the Proposition 65 list in the future. \\nBottlers of our beverage products presently offer, among other beverage containers, nonrefillable recyclable containers in the \\nUnited States and various other markets around the world. Some of these bottlers also offer and use refillable containers, which \\nare also recyclable. Legal requirements apply in various jurisdictions in the United States and elsewhere around the world \\nrequiring that deposits or certain ecotaxes or fees be charged in connection with the sale, marketing and use of certain beverage \\ncontainers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary. Other types of statutes and regulations relating to \\nbeverage container deposits, recycling, ecotaxes, product stewardship and/or restrictions or bans on the use of certain types of \\npackaging, including certain packaging containing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”), also apply in various \\njurisdictions in the United States and elsewhere around the world. We anticipate that additional such legal requirements may be \\nproposed or enacted in the future at federal, state and local levels, both in the United States and elsewhere around the world.\\nAll of our Company’s facilities and other operations in the United States and elsewhere around the world are subject to various \\nenvironmental protection statutes and regulations, including those relating to the use and treatment of water resources, \\ndischarge of wastewater and air emissions. In addition, increasing concern over climate change is expected to continue to result \\nin additional legal or regulatory requirements (both inside and outside the United States) designed to reduce or mitigate the \\neffects of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions on the environment, to discourage the use of plastic materials, to \\n9\\nlimit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns, or to expand disclosure of certain \\nsustainability metrics. Our policy is to comply with all such legal requirements. We have made, and plan on continuing to \\nmake, expenditures necessary to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations and to make progress toward \\nachieving our sustainability goals. While compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our Company’s capital \\nexpenditures, net income or competitive position, changes in environmental compliance requirements along with expenditures \\nnecessary to comply with such requirements and to make progress toward achieving our sustainability goals could adversely \\naffect our financial performance. \\nWe are also subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations related to cybersecurity, privacy and data \\nprotection, including the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, China’s Personal Information Protection Law \\nand the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), which became effective on January 1, 2020, as amended by the \\nCalifornia Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which became effective on January 1, 2023. In addition to California, at least 12 other \\nstates in the United States have passed comprehensive privacy laws similar to the CCPA and the CPRA. These laws are either \\nin effect or will go into effect sometime before the end of 2026, and we expect other states to consider adopting similar laws in \\nthe future. Like the CCPA and the CPRA, these laws create, or are expected to create, obligations related to the processing of \\npersonal information, as well as special obligations for the processing of “sensitive” data. Some of the provisions of these laws \\nmay apply to our business activities. The U.S. Congress has also considered legislation relating to data privacy and data \\nprotection, and the U.S. federal government may in the future pass such legislation. The interpretation and application of \\nprivacy, data protection and data residency laws are often uncertain and are expanding in the United States and internationally, \\nincluding in the European Union, Brazil, China and other jurisdictions. We monitor pending and proposed legislation and \\nregulatory initiatives to ascertain their relevance to and potential impact on our business, and we develop strategies to address \\nregulatory trends and developments, including any required changes to our privacy and data protection compliance programs \\nand policies. Globally, we see a trend toward data protection laws and regulations increasing in complexity and number, and we \\nanticipate that our obligations will expand commensurately. As a result, our ability to maximize the utility of our data could be \\nimpacted and we may need to modify our practices to accommodate legal and regulatory constraints and obligations or meet \\nconsumer expectations.\\nFor additional information, refer to Part I, “Item IA. Risk Factors” of this report.\\nHuman Capital Management\\nOur people and culture agendas are critical business priorities. Our Board of Directors, through the Talent and Compensation \\nCommittee, provides oversight of the Company’s policies and strategies relating to talent; leadership and culture, including \\ndiversity, equity and inclusion; and the Company’s compensation philosophy and programs. The Talent and Compensation \\nCommittee also evaluates and approves the Company’s compensation plans, policies and programs applicable to our senior \\nexecutives. In addition, the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee of our Board of Directors oversees succession \\nplanning and talent development for our senior executives. \\nEmployees\\nWe believe people are our most important asset, and we strive to attract and retain high-performing talent. As of December 31, \\n2023 and 2022, our Company had approximately 79,100 and 82,500 employees, respectively, of which approximately 9,000 \\nwere located in the United States. The decrease in the total number of employees was primarily due to 2023 refranchising \\nactivity. Our Company, through its divisions and subsidiaries, is a party to numerous collective bargaining agreements. As of \\nDecember 31, 2023, approximately 400 employees in North America were covered by collective bargaining agreements. These \\nagreements typically have terms of three to five years. We currently anticipate that we will be able to successfully renegotiate \\nsuch agreements when they expire. \\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\\nWe believe that a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace that reflects the markets we serve is a strategic business imperative \\nthat is critical to the Company’s continued growth and success. We take a comprehensive view of diversity, equity and \\ninclusion across different races, ethnicities, tribes, religions, socioeconomic backgrounds, generations, abilities, and expressions \\nof gender and sexual identity. \\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had approximately 7,600 employees located in the United States, excluding the employees of the \\nGlobal Ventures operating segment; fairlife; and BA Sports Nutrition, LLC (“BodyArmor”). Of these 7,600 employees, 42% \\nand 49% were female and people of color, respectively. \\nWe seek to create a better shared future for everyone our brands and business touch. We are focused on providing access to \\nequal opportunity and fostering belonging both in our workplaces and the local communities we proudly serve. We have \\npublicly announced our 2030 aspirations to reflect the markets we serve, including, for example, to be 50% led by women \\nglobally. Each of our operating units outside the United States has developed locally relevant diversity, equity and inclusion \\n10\\naspirations. Diversity and inclusion metrics, which highlight progress and help drive accountability, are shared with our senior \\nleaders on a quarterly basis.  \\nWe believe our sustainability goals, including our diversity, equity and inclusion aspirations, are key drivers for growth. \\nAccordingly, our compensation programs for our executives include qualitative and quantitative components to foster the \\ndesign and implementation of sustainable diversity, equity and inclusion strategies and programs that contribute to the \\nrecruitment, development and retention of diverse talent, as well as to encourage progress toward our diversity, equity and \\ninclusion aspirations.\\nWe conduct annual pay equity analyses, with regard to gender globally and race/ethnicity in the United States, to help ensure \\nour base pay structures are fair and to identify and address potential issues or disparities. Also, as permitted by U.S. law, during \\nthe annual rewards cycle, we perform an adverse impact analysis on base pay, annual incentives and long-term incentives to \\nhelp ensure fairness. When appropriate, we make adjustments. \\nWe support many employee-led inclusion networks, which are an integral part of operationalizing and embedding our diversity, \\nequity and inclusion strategies. Our inclusion networks are regionally structured to meet relevant local needs, and they provide \\nemployees with the opportunity to engage with colleagues around the world based on common interests or backgrounds. \\nTalent and Development \\nThrough our comprehensive global talent management processes, we continuously identify and develop our talent for \\nacceleration in our networked organization. We believe in providing challenging and diverse experiences and opportunities to \\nour people to help them develop and grow. \\nOur global career strategy program, called “Thrive,” is designed to provide clarity to employees on what it means to have a \\ncareer at the Company. Through our people-centered approach, we strive to create an integrated, streamlined and inspiring \\ncareer experience. We believe that development is anchored in acquiring skills and work experiences. We focus on investing in \\ninspirational leadership, capability development, and providing learning opportunities to equip our global workforce with the \\nskills they need for the future and to improve employee engagement and retention. We provide a range of formal and informal \\nlearning programs, which are designed to help our employees continuously grow and strengthen their skills throughout their \\ncareers. We provide online learning through a robust catalog of digital content as well as experiential learning opportunities, \\nand we are continually identifying opportunities to provide democratized access to content for all of our employees. We also \\nhave Thrive Opportunity Marketplace, a people-centered technology solution that helps connect project opportunities to \\ninterested employees who have the capacity, skills and interest in short-term experiences and assignments. Additionally, we \\noffer comprehensive Company-wide coaching and mentoring programs that support leadership and employee development at \\nall levels in our organization.\\nWe also believe that talent thrives in a growth-oriented environment where high performance and leadership effectiveness are \\nvalued. Our talent practices rely on data and feedback from multiple sources to help our employees get the transparent and \\ntimely feedback they need to be successful.\\nCompensation and Benefits\\nThrough comprehensive and competitive compensation and benefits, ongoing employee learning and development, and a focus \\non health and well-being, we strive to support our employees in all aspects of their lives. Our compensation programs are \\ndesigned to reinforce our growth agenda and our talent strategy as well as to drive a strong connection between the \\ncontributions of our employees and their pay. \\nWe believe our compensation packages provide the appropriate incentives to attract, retain and motivate our employees. We \\nprovide base pay that is competitive and that aligns with employee positions, skill levels, experience and geographic location. In \\naddition to base pay, we seek to reward employees with annual incentive awards, recognition programs, and equity awards for \\nemployees at certain job levels. \\nWe also offer competitive employee benefits packages, which vary by country and region. These employee benefits packages \\nmay include: 401(k) plan, pension plan, core and supplemental life insurance, financial courses and advisors, employee \\nassistance programs, tuition assistance, commuter assistance, adoption assistance, medical and dental insurance, vision \\ninsurance, health savings accounts, health reimbursement and flexible spending accounts, well-being rewards programs, \\nvacation pay, holiday pay, and parental and adoption leave.\\nCulture and Engagement \\nAs our employees work together to achieve our purpose to refresh the world and make a difference, they collectively build and \\nreinforce our culture. Our culture is rooted in our growth mindset, which expects each employee, leader and function to be \\ncurious, empowered, inclusive and agile. We use a variety of practices to measure and support progress against these growth \\nbehaviors and to ensure that our employees are engaged and fulfilled at work. For example, our Performance Enablement and \\n11\\nCulture & Engagement Survey platforms provide regular opportunities for employees across the organization to provide \\nfeedback on how their leaders, teammates and work experiences support the growth behaviors. Data from questionnaires are \\nanonymized and plotted against historical results to inform teams and functions on areas of strength and opportunities for \\nimprovement. We also encourage regular, live communication across the organization and host quarterly global town halls with \\nour senior leadership that include employee question-and-answer sessions. In addition, function-level town halls are held on a \\nregular basis. \\nAvailable Information\\nThe Company maintains a website at the following address: www.coca-colacompany.com.

RISK FACTORS\\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors, which could \\nmaterially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in future periods. The risks described below are not \\nthe only risks facing our Company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also \\nmay materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods. \\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS\\nUnfavorable general economic and geopolitical conditions could negatively impact our financial results.\\nOur business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected by changes in global economic \\nconditions, including global inflationary pressures, prevailing interest rates, credit market conditions, increased unemployment, \\nlevels of consumer and business confidence, bank failures, commodity (including energy) prices and supply, a recession or \\neconomic slowdown, trade policies, foreign currency exchange rates, changing policy positions or priorities, governmental rules \\nand approaches to taxation, levels of government spending and deficits, and actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt. \\nMany of the jurisdictions in which our products are sold have experienced, and could continue to experience, unfavorable \\nchanges in economic conditions, which could negatively affect the affordability of, and consumer demand for, our beverages, \\nand certain markets in which our products are sold experienced intensified inflation throughout 2023, which may continue to \\naccelerate in 2024. Under difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing \\npurchases of our products or by shifting away from our beverages to lower-priced products offered by other companies, \\nincluding private-label brands, which could reduce our profitability and negatively affect our overall financial performance. In \\naddition, the occurrence or resurgence of global or regional health events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the related \\ngovernmental, private sector and individual consumer responses, could contribute to a recession, depression or global economic \\ndownturn. \\nOther financial uncertainties in our major markets and unstable geopolitical conditions or events in certain markets, including \\ninternational conflicts, civil unrest, acts of war, terrorism, governmental changes, or changes in international relations, could \\nundermine global consumer confidence and reduce consumers’ purchasing power, thereby reducing demand for our products. \\nGeopolitical instability may also lead to heightened security risk, impacting employee safety and/or damage to infrastructure or \\nour assets. At times, we have faced product boycotts resulting from activism, which have reduced demand for our products. \\nRestrictions on our ability to transfer earnings or capital across borders, price controls, limitations on profits, retaliatory tariffs, \\nimport authorization requirements and other restrictions on business activities, which have been or may be imposed or \\nexpanded as a result of political and economic instability, deterioration of economic relations between countries or otherwise, \\ncould impact our profitability. In addition, U.S. trade sanctions against countries designated by the U.S. government as state \\nsponsors of terrorism and/or financial institutions accepting transactions for commerce within such countries could increase \\nsignificantly, which could make it difficult, or even impossible, for us to continue to make sales to bottlers in such countries. \\nThe imposition of retaliatory sanctions against U.S. multinational corporations by countries that are or may become subject to \\nU.S. trade sanctions, or the delisting of our branded products by retailers in various countries in reaction to U.S. trade sanctions \\nor other governmental actions or policies, could also negatively affect our business.\\n12\\nThroughout 2023, the Company faced disruptions to our operations due to international conflicts, including the conflict between \\nRussia and Ukraine and conflicts in the Middle East. These conflicts have resulted, and could continue to result, in volatile \\ncommodity markets; logistical, transportation and supply chain disruptions; increased risk of cyber incidents or other \\ndisruptions to our information systems; reputational risk; heightened risks to employee safety; business disruptions (including \\nlabor shortages); reduced availability and increased costs of transportation, energy, packaging, raw materials and other input \\ncosts; sanctions, export controls and other legislation or regulation; or difficulty protecting and enforcing our intellectual \\nproperty rights. While we currently do not anticipate that the effects of these conflicts will have a material impact on our results \\nof operations, we cannot predict how and the extent to which these conflicts will continue to affect our employees, operations, \\ncustomers or business partners.\\nIncreased competition could hurt our business. \\nWe operate in the highly competitive commercial beverage industry. For additional information regarding the competitive \\nenvironment in which we operate, including the names of certain of our significant competitors, refer to the heading \\n“Competition” set forth in Part I, “Item 1. Business” of this report. Our ability to maintain or gain share of sales in the global \\nmarket or in regional or local markets may be limited as a result of actions by competitors. Competitive pressures may cause the \\nCompany and our bottling partners to reduce prices we charge customers or may restrict our and our bottlers’ ability to increase \\nprices, as may be necessary in response to commodity and other cost increases. Such pressures may also increase marketing \\ncosts along with in-store placement, slotting and other marketing fees. In addition, the rapid growth of e-commerce may create \\nadditional consumer price deflation by, among other things, facilitating comparison shopping, and could potentially threaten the \\nvalue of some of our legacy route-to-market strategies and thus negatively affect revenues. If we do not continuously strengthen \\nour capabilities in marketing and innovation to maintain consumer interest, brand loyalty and market share while strategically \\nexpanding into other profitable categories of the commercial beverage industry, our business could be negatively affected. \\nIf we are not successful in our innovation activities, our financial results may be negatively affected. \\nAchieving our business growth objectives depends in part on our ability to evolve and improve our existing beverage products \\nthrough innovation and to successfully develop, introduce and market new beverage products. The success of our innovation \\nactivities depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance and trends; obtain, maintain and \\nenforce necessary intellectual property rights; and avoid infringing on the intellectual property rights of others. If we are not \\nsuccessful in our innovation activities, we may not be able to achieve our growth objectives, which may have a negative impact \\non our financial results. \\nChanges in the retail landscape or the loss of key retail or foodservice customers could adversely affect our financial results.\\nOur industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation in, and the blurring of the lines between, retail channels, \\nparticularly in Europe and the United States. Retailers may seek lower prices from us and our bottling partners, may demand \\nincreased marketing or promotional expenditures in support of their businesses, and may be more likely to use their distribution \\nnetworks to introduce and develop private-label brands, any of which could negatively affect the Coca-Cola system’s \\nprofitability. In addition, in developed markets, discounters and value stores are growing at a rapid pace, while in emerging and \\ndeveloping markets, modern trade is growing at a faster pace than traditional trade outlets. Our industry is also being affected \\nby the rapid growth in sales through e-commerce retailers, e-commerce websites, mobile commerce applications and \\nsubscription services, which may result in a shift away from physical retail operations to digital channels. As we and our \\nbottling partners build e-commerce capabilities, we may not be able to develop and maintain successful relationships with \\nexisting and new e-commerce retailers without experiencing a deterioration of our relationships with key customers operating \\nphysical retail channels. If we are unable to successfully adapt to the rapidly changing retail landscape, including the rapid \\ngrowth in digital commerce, our share of sales, volume growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected. In \\naddition, our success depends in part on our ability to maintain good relationships with key retail and foodservice customers. \\nThe loss of one or more of our key retail or foodservice customers could have an adverse effect on our financial performance. \\nIf we are unable to expand our business in emerging and developing markets, our growth could be negatively affected. \\nOur success depends in part on our ability to grow our business in emerging and developing markets, which in turn depends on \\neconomic and political conditions in those markets and on our ability to work with local bottlers to make necessary \\ninfrastructure enhancements to production facilities, distribution networks, sales equipment and technology. Additionally, we \\nrely on local availability of talented management and employees to establish and manage our operations in these markets. \\nScarcity of, or heavy competition for, talented employees could impede our abilities in such markets. Moreover, the supply of \\nour products in emerging and developing markets must match consumer demand for those products. Due to product price, \\nlimited purchasing power and cultural differences, our products may not be accepted in any particular emerging or developing \\nmarket. \\n13\\nIf we do not successfully manage the potential negative consequences of our productivity initiatives, our business operations \\ncould be adversely affected.\\nWe believe that improved productivity is essential to achieving our long-term growth objectives and, therefore, a leading \\npriority of our Company is to design and implement the most effective and efficient business model possible. Consequently, we \\ncontinuously search for productivity opportunities in our business. Some of the actions we may take from time to time in \\npursuing these opportunities may become a distraction for our managers and employees and may disrupt our ongoing business \\noperations; cause deterioration in employee morale, which may make it more difficult for us to retain or attract qualified \\nmanagers and employees; disrupt or weaken the internal control structures of the affected business operations; and give rise to \\nnegative publicity, which could affect our corporate reputation. If we are unable to successfully manage the potential negative \\nconsequences of our productivity initiatives, our business operations could be adversely affected.\\nIf we are unable to attract or retain a highly skilled and diverse workforce, our business could be negatively affected.\\nThe success of our business depends on our Company’s and the Coca-Cola system’s ability to attract, hire, develop, motivate \\nand retain a highly skilled and diverse workforce as well as on our success in nurturing a culture that supports our growth and \\naligns employees around the Company’s purpose and work that matters most. Competition for, along with compensation and \\nbenefits expectations of, existing and prospective employees has increased, especially in light of changing worker expectations \\nand talent marketplace variability regarding flexible work models. In addition, the broader labor market is experiencing a \\nshortage of qualified workers, which has further increased the competition we face for qualified employees. We may not be able \\nto successfully compete for, attract or retain the highly skilled and diverse workforce that we want and may require for our \\nfuture business needs, such as employees with advanced technology, artificial intelligence and machine learning, social media \\nand digital marketing skills, and/or digital and analytics capabilities. Changes in immigration laws and policies could also make \\nit more difficult for us to recruit or relocate highly skilled technical, professional and management personnel to meet our \\nbusiness needs. In addition, the unexpected loss of experienced and highly skilled employees due to an increase in aggressive \\nrecruiting for best-in-class talent could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitiveness. Failure to \\nattract, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled and diverse talent; to meet our goals related to fostering an inclusive \\nand diverse culture; to develop and implement an adequate succession plan for our management team; to maintain a corporate \\nculture that fosters innovation, collaboration and inclusion; or to design and successfully implement flexible work models that \\nmeet the expectations of employees and prospective employees could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business \\nand our future success. \\nDisruption of our supply chain, including increased commodity, raw material, packaging, energy, transportation and other \\ninput costs, may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\\nAt times, we have experienced, and could continue to experience, disruptions in our manufacturing operations and supply \\nchain. In connection with our manufacturing and bottling operations, we and our bottling partners are dependent upon, among \\nother things, various ingredients and other raw materials and packaging materials. For additional information on the raw \\nmaterials and supplies we use in our business, refer to the heading “Raw Materials” set forth in Part I, “Item 1. Business” of this \\nreport. Some of the raw materials and supplies used in the production of our products are available from a limited number of \\nsuppliers or from a sole supplier or are in short supply when seasonal demand is at its peak. We and our bottling partners may \\nnot be able to maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with these suppliers, and our contingency plans may not be \\neffective in preventing disruptions that may arise from shortages of any ingredients or other raw materials. Furthermore, some \\nof our suppliers are located in countries experiencing political instability or other risks and/or unfavorable economic conditions. \\nIn addition, adverse and extreme weather conditions may affect the supply of agricultural commodities from which key \\ningredients for our products are derived. Any sustained or significant disruption to the manufacturing or sourcing of products or \\nmaterials could increase our costs and interrupt product supply, which could adversely impact our business.\\nWe and our independent bottlers operate a large fleet of trucks and other motor vehicles to distribute beverage products to \\ncustomers. In addition, we and our independent bottlers use a significant amount of electricity, natural gas and other energy \\nsources to operate production plants, bottling plants and distribution facilities. Increases in energy demand have in the past \\nresulted, and could in the future result, in higher energy prices, impacting us and our independent bottlers.\\nThe raw materials and other supplies, including ingredients, agricultural commodities, energy, fuel, packaging materials, \\ntransportation, labor and other supply chain inputs that we use for the production and distribution of our products, are subject to \\nprice volatility and fluctuations in availability caused by many factors. These factors include changes in supply and demand; \\nsupplier capacity constraints; a deterioration of our or our bottling partners’ relationships with suppliers; international conflicts; \\npolitical uncertainties; acts of terrorism; governmental instability; inflation; weather conditions (including the effects of climate \\nchange); wildfires, floods and other natural disasters; disease or pests (including the impact of citrus greening disease on the \\ncitrus industry); agricultural uncertainty; health epidemics, pandemics or other contagious outbreaks (including COVID-19); \\nlabor shortages, strikes or work stoppages; changes in or the enactment of new laws and regulations; governmental actions or \\ncontrols (including import/export restrictions, such as new or increased tariffs, sanctions, quotas or trade barriers); port \\n14\\ncongestion or delays; transport capacity constraints; cybersecurity incidents or other disruptions; or fluctuations in foreign \\ncurrency exchange rates. Many of our raw materials and supplies are purchased in the open market and the prices we pay for \\nsuch items are subject to fluctuation. We expect the inflationary pressures on certain input and other costs to continue to impact \\nour business in 2024. \\nOur attempts to offset cost pressures, such as through price increases of some of our products, may not be successful. Higher \\nproduct prices may result in reductions in sales volume. Consumers may be less willing to pay a price differential for our \\nbranded products and may increasingly purchase lower-priced offerings, or may forgo some purchases altogether. To the extent \\nthat price increases are not sufficient to offset higher costs adequately or in a timely manner, and/or if they result in significant \\ndecreases in sales volume, our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. Furthermore, we may not \\nbe able to offset cost increases through productivity initiatives or through our commodity hedging activity.\\nIf we do not successfully integrate and manage our acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations, or if we are unable to \\nrealize a significant portion of the anticipated benefits of our joint ventures or strategic relationships, our financial results \\ncould suffer. \\nWe routinely evaluate opportunities to acquire businesses or brands to expand our beverage portfolio and capabilities. \\nAdditionally, from time to time, we have acquired or taken control of bottling operations, often in underperforming markets \\nwhere we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance. Acquisitions of businesses, brands or \\nbottling operations may involve significant challenges and risks, and the expected benefits, including cost and growth synergies \\nassociated with such acquisitions, may take longer to realize than expected or may not be realized at all. \\nWe have encountered, and may in the future encounter, challenges in successfully integrating the operations, technologies, \\nservices, products and systems of any acquired businesses, brands or bottling partners in an effective, timely and cost-efficient \\nmanner. We have faced, and may in the future face, difficulties in operating through new business models and/or supply chain \\nmodels, or in new categories or territories, and challenges in extending Company controls (including internal controls over \\nfinancial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, data protection and cybersecurity), policies and governance structures \\n(including with respect to food safety and quality, occupational safety, and sustainability) to newly acquired businesses, brands \\nor bottling operations, which, at times, has resulted in increased costs and negative publicity. Our financial performance is \\nimpacted by how well we can integrate and manage our acquisitions, and we may not be able to achieve our strategic and \\nfinancial objectives for acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations. If we incur unforeseen liabilities or costs in \\nconnection with acquiring or integrating businesses, brands or bottling operations, experience internal control or product quality \\nfailures, or are unable to achieve our strategic and financial objectives for acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations, \\nour consolidated results could be negatively affected. \\nWe also participate in the sales of other beverage brands through licenses, joint ventures and strategic relationships. If we are \\nunable to successfully manage our relationships with our joint venture partners or our strategic relationships, including our \\nrelationship with Monster, or if for any other reason we fail to realize all or a significant portion of the benefits we expect from \\nour joint ventures or strategic relationships, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\\nIf our third-party service providers and business partners do not satisfactorily fulfill their commitments and responsibilities, \\nor experience adverse events, our financial results could suffer. \\nIn the conduct of our business, we rely on relationships with third parties, including cloud data storage and other information \\ntechnology service providers, suppliers, distributors, contractors, joint venture partners and other external business partners, for \\ncertain services in support of key portions of our operations. These third parties are subject to similar risks as we are relating to \\ncybersecurity, privacy violations, business interruption, and systems and employee failures, and are subject to legal, regulatory \\nand market risks of their own. Our third-party service providers and business partners may not fulfill their respective \\ncommitments and responsibilities in a timely manner and in accordance with the agreed-upon terms or applicable laws. In \\naddition, while we have procedures in place for assessing risk along with selecting, managing and monitoring our relationships \\nwith third-party service providers and other business partners, we do not have control over their business operations or \\ngovernance and compliance systems, practices and procedures, which increases our financial, legal, cybersecurity, reputational \\nand operational risk. If we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships, or for any reason our third-party \\nservice providers or business partners fail to satisfactorily fulfill their commitments and responsibilities or experience events \\nthat could directly or indirectly impact us, our financial results could suffer.\\nIf we are unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, or if we or our bottling partners \\nexperience strikes, work stoppages or labor unrest, our business could suffer. \\nMany of our employees at our key manufacturing locations and bottling plants are covered by collective bargaining agreements. \\nWhile we generally have been able to renegotiate collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire and \\nregard our relations with employees and their representatives as generally satisfactory, negotiations may nevertheless be \\nchallenging, as the Company must have competitive cost structures in each market while meeting the compensation and \\n15\\nbenefits needs of our employees. If we are unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, our labor \\ncosts could increase, which could affect our profit margins. In addition, many of our bottling partners’ employees are \\nrepresented by labor unions. Strikes, work stoppages or other forms of labor unrest at any of our major manufacturing facilities \\nor at our bottling operations or our major bottlers’ plants could impair our ability to supply concentrates and syrups to our \\nbottling partners or our bottlers’ ability to supply finished beverages to customers, which could reduce our net operating \\nrevenues and could expose us to customer claims. Furthermore, from time to time, we and our bottling partners restructure \\nmanufacturing and other operations to improve productivity, which may have negative impacts on employee morale and work \\nperformance, result in escalation of grievances and adversely affect the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements. If these \\nlabor relations are not effectively managed at the local level, they could escalate in the form of corporate campaigns supported \\nby the labor organizations and could negatively affect our Company’s overall reputation and brand image, which in turn could \\nhave a negative impact on our products’ acceptance by consumers.\\nRISKS RELATED TO CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS \\nObesity and other health-related concerns may reduce demand for some of our products. \\nThere is concern among consumers, public health professionals and government agencies about the health problems associated \\nwith obesity. Ongoing public concern about obesity; other health-related public concerns surrounding consumption of \\nsweetened beverages; the effects or perceived effects of the usage of weight-loss drugs on consumption patterns; potential new \\nor increased taxes on sweetened beverages by government entities to reduce consumption or to raise revenue; additional \\ngovernmental regulations concerning the advertising, marketing, labeling, packaging or sale of our sweetened beverages; and \\nnegative publicity resulting from actual or threatened legal actions against us or other companies in our industry relating to the \\nmarketing, labeling or sale of sweetened beverages may reduce demand for, or increase the cost of, our sweetened beverages, \\nwhich could adversely affect our profitability.\\nIf we do not address evolving consumer product and shopping preferences, our business could suffer. \\nConsumer product preferences have evolved and continue to evolve as a result of, among other things, health, wellness and \\nnutrition considerations, including concerns regarding caloric intake associated with sweetened beverages and the perceived \\nundesirability of artificial ingredients; concerns regarding the perceived health effects of, or location of origin of, ingredients, \\nraw materials or substances in our products or packaging, including due to the results of third-party studies (whether or not \\nscientifically valid); shifting consumer demographics; changes in consumer tastes and needs coupled with a rapid expansion of \\nbeverage options and delivery methods; changes in consumer lifestyles; concerns regarding the environmental, social and \\nsustainability impact of ingredient sources and the product manufacturing process; consumer emphasis on transparency related \\nto ingredients we use in our products and collection and recyclability of, and amount of recycled content contained in, our \\npackaging containers and other materials; concerns about the health and welfare of animals in our dairy supply chain; and \\ncompetitive product and pricing pressures. In addition, in many of our markets, shopping patterns are being affected by the \\ndigital evolution, with consumers rapidly embracing shopping by way of mobile device applications, e-commerce retailers and \\ne-commerce websites or platforms. If we fail to address changes in consumer product and shopping preferences, do not \\nsuccessfully anticipate and prepare for future changes in such preferences, or are ineffective or slow in developing and \\nimplementing appropriate digital transformation initiatives, our share of sales, revenue growth and overall financial results \\ncould be negatively affected.\\nProduct safety and quality concerns could negatively affect our business. \\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of all of our \\nproducts. We have rigorous product safety and quality standards, which we expect our operations as well as our bottling \\npartners to meet. However, despite our strong commitment to product safety and quality, we or our bottling partners at times \\nhave not met, and may not always meet, these standards, particularly as we expand our product offerings through innovation or \\nacquisitions into beverage categories, such as value-added dairy and plant-based beverages, that are beyond our traditional \\nrange of beverage products. We and our bottling partners have had, and may in the future need, to recall products if they \\nbecome contaminated or adulterated by any means or if they are mislabeled. A widespread product recall could result in \\nsignificant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of \\nproduct for a period of time, and could also subject us to product liability claims and negative publicity, all of which could \\ncause our business to suffer.\\nPublic debate and concern about perceived negative health consequences of certain ingredients, such as non-nutritive \\nsweeteners and biotechnology-derived substances, and of other substances present in our beverage products or packaging \\nmaterials, may reduce demand for our beverage products or result in additional governmental regulation. \\nPublic debate and concern about perceived negative health consequences of certain ingredients in our beverage products, such \\nas synthetic colors, non-nutritive sweeteners and biotechnology-derived substances; substances that are present in our beverage \\nproducts naturally or that occur as a result of the manufacturing process, such as 4-methylimidazole (“4-MEI”), a chemical \\n16\\ncompound that is formed during the manufacturing of certain types of caramel coloring used in cola-flavored beverages; or \\nsubstances used in packaging materials, such as bisphenol A (“BPA”), an odorless, tasteless food-grade chemical commonly \\nused in the food and beverage industries as a component in the coating of the interior of cans, may affect consumers’ \\npreferences and cause them to shift away from some of our beverage products. In addition, increasing public concern about \\nperceived or potential health consequences of the presence of ingredients or substances in our beverage products or in \\npackaging materials (or alleged presence of substances such as PFAS) and/or the results of third-party studies (whether or not \\nscientifically valid) purporting to assess the health implications of consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in \\ncertain of our products or packaging materials have resulted, and could result, in additional governmental regulations \\nconcerning the advertising, marketing, labeling, packaging or sale of our beverages; limitations on the use of certain ingredients \\nor packaging; potential new or increased taxes on our beverages by government entities; and negative publicity, or actual or \\nthreatened legal actions against us or other companies in our industry, all of which could damage the reputation of, and may \\nreduce demand for, our beverage products. \\nIf we are not successful in our efforts to digitalize the Coca-Cola system, our financial results could be negatively affected. \\nThe digital evolution is affecting how we interact with consumers, customers, suppliers, bottlers and other business partners and \\nstakeholders. We believe our future success will depend in part on our ability to adapt to and thrive in the digital environment. \\nTherefore, one of our top priorities is to digitalize the Coca-Cola system by, among other things, creating more relevant and \\nmore personalized experiences wherever our system interacts with consumers, whether in a digital environment or through \\ndigital devices in an otherwise physical environment; finding ways to create more powerful digital tools and capabilities for the \\nCoca-Cola system’s retail customers to enable them to grow their businesses; and digitalizing operations through the use of \\ndata, artificial intelligence, automation, robotics and digital devices to increase efficiency and productivity. If we are not \\nsuccessful in our efforts to digitalize the Coca-Cola system, our ability to increase sales and improve margins may be negatively \\naffected, and the cost and expenses we have incurred or may incur in connection with our digitalization initiatives may \\nadversely impact our financial performance. \\nIf negative publicity, whether or not warranted, concerning product safety or quality, workplace and human rights, obesity \\nor other issues damages our brand image, corporate reputation and social license to operate, our business may suffer.\\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to maintain the brand image of our existing products, build the brand image for \\nnew products and brand extensions, and maintain our corporate reputation and social license to operate. However, our \\ncontinuing investment in advertising and marketing and our strong commitment to product safety and quality and human rights \\nhave not always had, and may not in the future always have, the desired impact on our products’ brand image and on consumer \\npreferences. Product safety or quality issues, actual or perceived, or allegations of product contamination, even when false or \\nunfounded, could tarnish the image of the affected brands and may cause consumers to choose other products. In some \\nemerging markets, the production and sale of counterfeit or “spurious” products, which we and our bottling partners may not be \\nable to fully combat, may damage the image and reputation of our products. In addition, from time to time, we and our \\nexecutives have engaged, and may in the future engage, in public policy endeavors that are either directly related to our \\nproducts and packaging or to our business operations and the general economic climate affecting the Company. These \\nengagements in public policy debates have been, and could in the future be, the subject of criticism from advocacy groups or \\nothers that have a differing point of view and could result in adverse media and consumer reaction, including product boycotts. \\nSimilarly, our sponsorship relationships and associations with influencers have subjected us in the past, and could subject us in \\nthe future, to negative publicity as a result of actual or alleged misconduct by individuals, hosts or entities associated with \\norganizations we sponsor or support financially or through in-kind contributions, as well as by the influencers we collaborate \\nwith who may engage in actions or express opinions that may negatively reflect on our brand. Likewise, campaigns by activists \\nconnecting us, or our bottling system or supply chain, with workplace, human rights or animal welfare issues, whether actual or \\nperceived, could adversely impact our corporate image and reputation. Additionally, negative postings or comments on social \\nmedia or networking websites about the Company or one of its brands, even if inaccurate or malicious, have in the past, and \\ncould in the future, generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the Company. Furthermore, \\nallegations, even if untrue, that we are not respecting internationally recognized human rights; actual or perceived failure by our \\nsuppliers or other business partners to comply with applicable workplace and labor laws, including child labor laws, or their \\nactual or perceived abuse or misuse of migrant workers; actual or perceived failure by our suppliers, joint venture partners or \\nother business partners to engage in proper animal welfare practices; and adverse publicity surrounding obesity and health \\nconcerns related to our products, water usage, environmental impact, labor relations or the like could negatively affect our \\nCompany’s overall reputation and brand image, which in turn could have a negative impact on our products’ acceptance by \\nconsumers. In addition, if we fail to respect our employees’ and our supply chain workers’ human rights, or inadvertently \\ndiscriminate against any group of employees or hiring prospects, our ability to hire and retain the best talent will be diminished, \\nwhich could have an adverse impact on our overall business. \\n17\\nIf we are unable to successfully manage new product launches, our business and financial results could be adversely \\naffected. \\nDue to the highly competitive nature of the commercial beverage industry, the Company continually introduces new products \\nand evolves existing products to stimulate consumer demand. For instance, the Company has directly entered the alcohol \\nbeverage category in numerous markets outside the United States, and in the United States, the Company has established a \\nwholly owned, indirect, firewalled subsidiary, which authorizes alcohol-licensed third parties to use certain of our trademarks \\nand related intellectual property on alcohol beverages that contain Company beverage bases. The success of new and evolved \\nproducts depends on several factors, including timely and successful product development, adherence to new global and/or \\nlocal standards of practice, consumer acceptance and stakeholder perception. Such endeavors may also involve significant risks \\nand uncertainties, including greater execution risks; higher costs; lower rates of sales; distraction of management from existing \\noperations; lower product, category or industry knowledge and expertise; slower than expected or inadequate return on \\ninvestments; increased competitive pressures; stakeholder scrutiny; and reliance on the performance of third parties. As we \\nbecome subject to additional governmental regulations, including alcohol regulations related to licensing, trade and pricing \\npractices, labeling, advertising, promotion and marketing practices, and relationships with distributors, we may become \\nexposed to the risk of increased compliance costs and disruptions to our existing business.\\nRISKS RELATED TO THE COCA-COLA SYSTEM \\nWe rely on our bottling partners for a significant portion of our business. If we are unable to maintain good relationships \\nwith our bottling partners, our business could suffer. \\nWe generate a significant portion of our net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to independent bottling \\npartners. As independent companies, our bottling partners, some of which are publicly traded companies, make their own \\nbusiness decisions that may not always align with our interests. In addition, some of our bottling partners have the right to \\nmanufacture or distribute their own products or certain products of other beverage companies. If we are unable to maintain \\noperating and strategic alignment or agree on appropriate pricing and marketing and advertising support, or if our bottling \\npartners are not satisfied with our brand innovation and development efforts, they may take actions that, while maximizing  \\ntheir own short-term profits, may be detrimental to our Company or our brands, or they may devote more of their resources   \\nto business opportunities or products other than those of the Company. Such actions could, in the long term, have an adverse \\neffect on our profitability. \\nIf our bottling partners’ financial condition deteriorates, our business and financial results could be affected. \\nIn the vast majority of our markets, our products are sold and distributed by independent bottling partners, and we therefore \\nderive a significant portion of our net operating revenues from sales of concentrates and syrups to independent bottling partners. \\nAccordingly, the success of our business depends in part on our bottling partners’ financial strength and profitability. While \\nunder our agreements with our bottling partners we generally have the right to unilaterally change the prices we charge for our \\nconcentrates and syrups, our ability to do so may be materially limited by our bottling partners’ financial condition and their \\nability to pass price increases along to their customers. In addition, we have investments in certain of our bottling partners, \\nwhich we account for under the equity method, and our operating results include our proportionate share of such bottling \\npartners’ income or loss. Our bottling partners’ financial condition is affected in large part by conditions and events that are \\nbeyond our and their control, including competitive and general market conditions; the availability of capital and other \\nfinancing resources on reasonable terms; loss of major customers; changes in or additional regulations; or disruptions of \\nbottling operations that may be caused by strikes, work stoppages, labor unrest, natural disasters, international conflicts, acts of \\nwar, health epidemics, pandemics or other catastrophic events. A deterioration of the financial condition or results of operations \\nof one or more of our major bottling partners could adversely affect our net operating revenues from sales of concentrates and \\nsyrups; and, if such deterioration involves one or more of our equity method investee bottling partners, it could also result in a \\ndecrease in our equity income and/or impairments of our equity method investments.\\nWe may from time to time engage in refranchising activities or divestitures of certain brands or businesses, which could \\nadversely affect our business and results of operations.\\nAs part of our strategic initiative to focus on our core business of building brands and leading our system of bottling partners, \\nwe continue to seek opportunities to refranchise our consolidated bottling operations. Our refranchising activities require \\nsignificant attention and effort on the part of, and therefore may be a distraction for, senior management. If we are unable to \\ncomplete future refranchising transactions on terms and conditions favorable to us, or if our refranchising partners are not \\nefficient or not aligned with our long-term vision for the Coca-Cola system, our business and results of operations could be \\nadversely affected. Additionally, we have divested and may in the future divest certain brands or businesses. These divestitures \\nmay adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition if we are unable to offset impacts \\nfrom the loss of revenue associated with the divested brands or businesses, or if we are otherwise unable to achieve the \\nanticipated benefits or cost savings from such divestitures. \\n18\\nRISKS RELATED TO REGULATORY AND LEGAL MATTERS \\nIncreases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or regulations, or unfavorable resolutions of tax matters could \\nhave a material adverse impact on our financial results. \\nWe are subject to income tax in the United States and numerous other jurisdictions in which we generate profits. Our overall \\neffective income tax rate is a function of applicable local tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate, tax treaties between \\nsuch jurisdictions, and the geographic mix of our income before income taxes, which is itself impacted by currency movements. \\nConsequently, the isolated or combined effects of unfavorable movements in tax rates, geographic mix or foreign currency \\nexchange rates could reduce our net income. Tax laws and regulations, including rates of taxation, are subject to revisions by \\nindividual taxing jurisdictions, and such revisions may result from multilateral agreements. \\nMany jurisdictions have enacted legislation and adopted policies resulting from the Organization for Economic Co-operation \\nand Development’s (“OECD”) Anti-Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project. The OECD is currently coordinating a two \\npillared project on behalf of the G20 and other participating countries which would grant additional taxing rights over profits \\nearned by multinational enterprises to the countries in which their products are sold and services rendered. Pillar One would \\nallow countries to reallocate a portion of profits earned by multinational businesses with an annual global revenue exceeding \\n€20 billion and a profit margin of over 10% to applicable market jurisdictions. While the OECD issued draft language for the \\ninternational implementation of Pillar One in October 2023, both the substantive rules and implementation process remain \\nunder discussion at the OECD so the timetable for any implementation remains uncertain. \\nIn December 2021, the OECD issued Pillar Two model rules which would establish a global per-country minimum tax of 15%, \\nand the European Union has approved a directive requiring member states to incorporate similar provisions into their respective \\ndomestic laws. The directive requires the rules to initially become effective for fiscal years starting on or after December 31, \\n2023. While it is uncertain whether the United States will enact legislation to adopt Pillar Two, numerous countries have \\nenacted legislation, or have indicated their intent to adopt legislation, to implement certain aspects of Pillar Two effective \\nJanuary 1, 2024, with general implementation of the remaining global minimum tax rules by January 1, 2025. The OECD and \\nimplementing countries are expected to continue to make further revisions to their legislation and release additional guidance. \\nThe Company will continue to monitor developments to determine any potential impact in the countries in which we operate. \\nTo the extent additional legislative changes take place in the countries in which we operate, it is possible that these changes \\nmay increase uncertainty and have a material impact on our net income and cash flow. Significant judgment is required in \\ndetermining our annual income tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions. Although we believe our tax estimates are \\nreasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical \\nincome tax provisions, estimates and accruals. The results of audits or related disputes could have a material adverse effect on \\nour financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made and for periods for \\nwhich the statute of limitations is open.\\nFor instance, the United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) is seeking to increase our U.S. taxable income for tax years \\n2007 through 2009 by an amount that creates a potential additional U.S. federal income tax liability of approximately \\n$3.3 billion for that period, plus interest. The Company firmly believes that the IRS’ claims are without merit and is pursuing, \\nand will continue to pursue, all available administrative and judicial remedies necessary to vigorously defend its position. On \\nNovember 18, 2020, the U.S. Tax Court (“Tax Court”) issued an opinion (“Opinion”) predominantly siding with the IRS. On \\nNovember 8, 2023, the Tax Court issued a supplemental opinion (together with the original Tax Court opinion, “Opinions”) \\nalso siding with the IRS as to the validity of the blocked-income regulations and its application to the Brazilian legal \\nrestrictions. Although the Company disagrees with the unfavorable portions of the Opinions and intends to vigorously defend \\nits position, considering all avenues of appeal, there is no assurance that the courts will ultimately rule in the Company’s favor. \\nIt is therefore possible that all or some of the unfavorable portions of the Opinions could ultimately be upheld. In that event, the \\nCompany would be subject to significant additional liabilities for the years at issue and potentially also for the subsequent years \\nif the unfavorable portions of the Opinions were to be applied to the foreign licensees covered within the scope of the Opinions. \\nMoreover, the IRS could successfully appeal the portions of the Opinions that are favorable to the Company and/or assert new \\nclaims for additional tax relating to the subsequent years by broadening the scope to cover additional foreign licensees. These \\nadjustments could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. \\nAny such adjustments related to years prior to 2018, either in the litigation period or thereafter, may also have an impact on the \\ntransition tax payable as part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform Act”). For additional information regarding the \\ntax litigation, refer to Part I, “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” of this report.\\nIncreased or new indirect taxes could negatively affect our business. \\nOur business operations are subject to numerous duties or taxes that are not based on income, sometimes referred to as “indirect \\ntaxes,” including import duties, tariffs, excise taxes, sales or value-added taxes, taxes on sweetened or aerated beverages, \\npackaging taxes, carbon taxes, property taxes and payroll taxes, in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, in \\nthe past, the U.S. Congress considered imposing a federal excise tax on beverages sweetened with sugar, HFCS or other \\n19\\nnutritive sweeteners and may consider similar proposals in the future. As federal, state and local governments in the United \\nStates and throughout the world experience significant budget deficits, some lawmakers have singled out beverages among a \\nplethora of revenue-raising items and have imposed or increased, or proposed to impose or increase, sales or similar taxes on \\nbeverages, particularly sweetened beverages and alcohol beverages, as well as packaging and/or packaging materials. Increases \\nin or the imposition of new indirect taxes on our business operations or products would increase the cost of products or, to the \\nextent levied directly on consumers, make our products less affordable, which may negatively impact our net operating \\nrevenues and profitability. \\nChanges in laws and regulations relating to beverage containers and packaging could increase our costs and reduce \\ndemand for our products. \\nWe and our bottlers offer, among other beverage containers, nonrefillable containers in the United States and in various other \\nmarkets around the world. Legal requirements have been enacted in various jurisdictions requiring that deposits or certain \\necotaxes or fees be charged in connection with the sale, marketing and use of certain beverage containers. Other proposals \\nrelating to beverage container deposits, recycling, recycling content, tethered bottle caps, ecotax and/or product stewardship, or \\nprohibitions on certain types of plastic products, packages and cups (including packaging containing PFAS) have been \\nintroduced and/or adopted in various jurisdictions, and we anticipate that similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in \\nthe future at federal, state and local levels, both in the United States and elsewhere. Consumers’ increased concerns and \\nchanging attitudes about solid waste streams and environmental responsibility and the related publicity could result in the \\nadoption of additional such legislation or regulations in the future. If these types of requirements are adopted and implemented \\non a large scale, they could affect our costs or require changes in our distribution model, which could reduce our net operating \\nrevenues and profitability. \\nSignificant additional labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products may inhibit \\nsales of affected products. \\nVarious jurisdictions have adopted, and may seek to adopt, significant additional product labeling or warning requirements or \\nlimitations on the marketing or sale of our products because of what they contain or allegations that they cause adverse health \\neffects. If these types of requirements become applicable to one or more of our products under current or future environmental \\nor health laws or regulations, they may inhibit sales of such products or make it necessary for us to reformulate certain of our \\nproducts, resulting in adverse effects on our business.\\nFor example, under one such law in California, known as Proposition 65, if the state has determined that a substance causes \\ncancer or harms human reproduction or development, a warning must be provided for any product sold in the state that exposes \\nconsumers to that substance, unless the exposure falls under an established safe harbor level or another exemption is applicable. \\nFor additional information regarding Proposition 65, refer to the heading “Governmental Regulation” set forth in Part I,     \\n“Item 1. Business” of this report. If we were required to add Proposition 65 warnings on the labels of one or more of our \\nbeverage products produced for sale in California, the resulting consumer reaction to the warnings and potential adverse \\npublicity could negatively affect our sales both in California and in other markets. \\nLitigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation. \\nWe are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, \\nthose arising out of our advertising and marketing practices, product claims and labels, competition, distribution and pricing, \\npersonal data protection and privacy, intellectual property and commercial disputes, tax disputes, and environmental and \\nemployment matters. We evaluate these litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes \\nand to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we establish reserves and/\\nor disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings, as appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on the \\ninformation available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of management judgment. Actual outcomes \\nor losses may differ materially from our current assessments and estimates. \\nWe conduct business in markets with high-risk legal compliance environments, which exposes us to increased legal and \\nreputational risk. \\nWe have bottling and other business operations in markets with high-risk legal compliance environments. Our policies and \\nprocedures require strict compliance by our employees and agents with all United States and local laws and regulations and \\nconsent orders applicable to our business operations, including those prohibiting improper payments to government officials. \\nNonetheless, our policies, procedures and related training programs may not always ensure full compliance by our employees \\nand agents with all applicable legal requirements. Improper conduct by our employees or agents could damage our reputation in \\nthe United States and internationally or lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties, \\nincluding substantial monetary fines as well as disgorgement of profits. \\n20\\nFailure to adequately protect, or disputes relating to, trademarks, formulas and other intellectual property rights could harm \\nour business. \\nOur trademarks, formulas and other intellectual property rights (refer to the heading “Patents, Copyrights, Trade Secrets and \\nTrademarks” in Part I, “Item 1. Business” of this report) are essential to the success of our business. We cannot be certain that \\nthe legal steps we are taking around the world are sufficient to protect our intellectual property rights or that, notwithstanding \\nlegal protection, others do not or will not infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property rights. If we fail to adequately \\nprotect our intellectual property rights, or if changes in laws diminish or remove the current legal protections available to them, \\nthe competitiveness of our products may be eroded and our business could suffer. In addition, we could come into conflict with \\nthird parties over intellectual property rights, which could result in disruptive and expensive litigation. Any of the foregoing \\ncould harm our business. \\nChanges in, or failure to comply with, the laws and regulations applicable to our products or our business operations could \\nincrease our costs or reduce our net operating revenues. \\nOur Company is subject to various laws and regulations in the countries and territories throughout the world in which we do \\nbusiness, including laws and regulations relating to competition, distribution and pricing, product safety, product design, \\nadvertising and labeling, container deposits, recycling, recycled content, product stewardship, the protection of the \\nenvironment, occupational health and safety, employment and labor practices, machine learning and artificial intelligence, \\npersonal data protection and privacy, and data security. For additional information regarding laws and regulations applicable to \\nour business, refer to the heading “Governmental Regulation” set forth in Part I, “Item 1. Business” of this report. Changes in \\napplicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof, changes in enforcement priorities of regulators, and differing \\nor competing regulations and standards across the markets where our products or raw materials are made, manufactured, \\ndistributed or sold, have in the past resulted in, and could continue to result in, higher compliance costs, higher capital \\nexpenditures and higher production costs, or make it necessary for us to reformulate certain of our products, resulting in adverse \\neffects on our business. In addition, increased or additional regulations to limit and/or report carbon dioxide and other \\ngreenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change; to discourage the use of plastic materials, including \\nregulations relating to recovery and/or disposal of plastic bottles and other packaging materials due to environmental concerns; \\nto limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns; or to address wastewater \\ndischarge to protect local bodies of water, have in the past and could continue to result in increased compliance costs, capital \\nexpenditures and other financial obligations for us and our bottling partners, which could affect our profitability, or may impede \\nthe production, distribution, marketing and sale of our products, which could affect our net operating revenues. Failure to \\ncomply with various laws and regulations (or allegations thereof), such as U.S. trade sanctions, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt \\nPractices Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control trade sanction regulations and anti-boycott regulations; antitrust and \\ncompetition laws; anti-modern slavery laws; anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws; data privacy laws, including the European \\nUnion’s General Data Protection Regulation and China’s Personal Information Protection Law; tax laws and regulations; and a \\nvariety of other applicable local, national and multinational regulations and laws, could result in litigation or criminal or civil \\nenforcement actions, including voluntary and involuntary document requests, the assessment of damages, the imposition of \\npenalties, the suspension of production or distribution, costly changes to equipment or processes due to required corrective \\naction, or the cessation or interruption of operations at our or our bottling partners’ facilities, as well as damage to our or our \\nbottling partners’ image and reputation, all of which could harm our or our bottling partners’ profitability. \\nRISKS RELATED TO FINANCE, ACCOUNTING AND INVESTMENTS \\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. \\nWe earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using many currencies other than the U.S. dollar. \\nIn 2023, we derived $29.2 billion of net operating revenues from operations outside the United States. Because our consolidated \\nfinancial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and \\nliabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or \\ndecreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies affect our net operating revenues, operating income and the \\nvalue of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Global events, including political instability, international \\nconflicts, trade disputes, economic sanctions, inflation, increasing interest rates and emerging market volatility, and the \\nresulting uncertainties, may cause currencies to fluctuate in relation to the U.S. dollar. Due to the geographic diversity of our \\noperations, weakness in some currencies may be offset by strength in other currencies over time. We also use derivative \\nfinancial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. However, fluctuations in \\nforeign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies or the currencies of \\nlarge developing countries, could materially affect our financial results. \\nIf interest rates increase, our net income could be negatively affected. \\nWe maintain levels of debt that we consider prudent based on our cash flows, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to \\ncapital. We use debt financing to lower our cost of capital, which increases our return on shareowners’ equity. This exposes us \\n21\\nto adverse changes in interest rates. When and to the extent appropriate, we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our \\nexposure to interest rate risks. However, our financial risk management program may not be successful in reducing the risks \\ninherent in exposures to interest rate fluctuations. On December 31, 2021, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, \\nthe governing body responsible for regulating the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), ceased to publish certain LIBOR \\nreference rates. Other LIBOR reference rates, including U.S. dollar overnight, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month \\nmaturities, ceased to be published in July 2023. As a result of the discontinuation of LIBOR, we have amended our LIBOR-\\nreferencing agreements to either reference the Secured Overnight Financing Rate or include mechanics for selecting an \\nalternative rate, but it is possible that these changes may have an adverse impact on our financing costs as compared to LIBOR \\nin the long term. Our interest expense may also be affected by our credit ratings. In assessing our credit strength, credit rating \\nagencies consider our capital structure and financial policies as well as the consolidated balance sheet and other financial \\ninformation of the Company. In addition, some credit rating agencies also consider financial information of certain of our major \\nbottling partners. It is our expectation that the credit rating agencies will continue using this methodology. If our credit ratings \\nwere to be downgraded as a result of changes in our capital structure; our major bottling partners’ financial performance; \\nchanges in the credit rating agencies’ methodology in assessing our credit strength; the credit agencies’ perception of the impact \\nof credit market conditions on our or our major bottling partners’ current or future financial performance and financial \\ncondition; or for any other reason, our cost of borrowing could increase. Additionally, if the credit ratings of certain bottling \\npartners in which we have equity method investments were to be downgraded, such bottling partners’ interest expense could \\nincrease, which would reduce our equity income. \\nIf we are unable to achieve our overall long-term growth objectives, the value of an investment in our Company could be \\nnegatively affected. \\nWe have established and publicly announced certain long-term growth objectives. These objectives are based on, among other \\nthings, our evaluation of our growth prospects, which are generally driven by the sales potential of our many beverage products, \\nsome of which are more profitable than others, and on an assessment of the potential price and product mix. We may not be \\nable to realize the sales potential and the price and product mix necessary to achieve our long-term growth objectives. \\nDefault by or failure of one or more of our counterparty financial institutions could cause us to incur significant losses. \\nAs part of our hedging activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments, including forward \\ncontracts, commodity futures contracts, option contracts, collars and swaps, with various financial institutions. In addition, we \\nhave significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial \\ninstitutions in the United States and abroad. As a result, we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty \\nfinancial institutions. The risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of \\nuncertainty in the financial markets. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to \\nrecover losses incurred as a result of default or to retrieve our assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such \\ncounterparty may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy \\nproceedings. In the event of default by or failure of one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which \\ncould negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. \\nWe may be required to recognize impairment charges that could materially affect our financial results. \\nWe assess our noncurrent assets, including trademarks, goodwill and other intangible assets, equity method investments and \\nother long-lived assets, as and when required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States to determine \\nwhether they are impaired and, if they are, we record appropriate impairment charges. Our equity method investees also \\nperform similar recoverability and impairment tests, and we record our proportionate share of impairment charges recorded by \\nthem adjusted, as appropriate, for the impact of items such as basis differences, deferred taxes and deferred gains. It is possible \\nthat we may be required to record significant impairment charges or our proportionate share of significant impairment charges \\nrecorded by equity method investees in the future and, if we do so, our net income could be materially adversely affected.\\nRISKS RELATED TO CYBERSECURITY AND DATA PRIVACY\\nIf we are unable to protect our information systems against service interruption, misappropriation of data or cybersecurity \\nincidents, our operations could be disrupted, we may suffer financial losses and our reputation may be damaged. \\nWe rely on networks and information systems and other technology (“information systems”), including the Internet and third-\\nparty hosted services, to support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement and supply chain, \\nmanufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection of payments, employee processes, consumer marketing, mergers and \\nacquisitions, and research and development. We use information systems to process financial information and results of \\noperations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting and legal and tax requirements. In \\naddition, we depend on information systems for digital marketing activities and electronic communications among our locations \\naround the world and between Company employees and our bottlers, customers, suppliers, consumers and other third parties. \\nBecause information systems are critical to many of the Company’s operating activities, our business may be impacted by \\n22\\nsystem shutdowns, service disruptions or cybersecurity incidents. These incidents may be caused by failures during routine \\noperations, such as system upgrades, or by user errors, as well as network or hardware failures, malicious or disruptive \\nsoftware, unintentional or malicious actions of employees or contractors, cyberattacks by hackers, criminal groups or nation-\\nstate organizations (which may include deepfake or social engineering schemes, ransomware and other forms of malware, \\nbusiness email compromise, cyber extortion, denial of service, or attempts to exploit vulnerabilities or gain unauthorized \\naccess), geopolitical events, natural disasters, failures or impairments of telecommunications networks, or other catastrophic \\nevents. Cybercriminals have increasingly demonstrated advanced capabilities, such as use of zero-day vulnerabilities, and rapid \\nintegration of new technology such as generative artificial intelligence. In addition, cybersecurity incidents could result in \\nunauthorized or accidental access to or disclosure of material confidential information or regulated personal data. If our \\ninformation systems or third-party information systems on which we rely suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our \\nbusiness continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in reporting our \\nfinancial results, and we may lose revenue and profits as a result of our inability to timely manufacture, distribute, invoice and \\ncollect payments for concentrates or finished products. Unauthorized or accidental access to, or destruction, loss, alteration, \\ndisclosure, falsification or unavailability of, information, or unauthorized access to machines and equipment could result in \\nviolations of data protection laws and regulations, misuse or malfunction of machines and equipment, damage to the reputation \\nand credibility of the Company, loss of opportunities to acquire or divest of businesses or brands, and loss of ability to \\ncommercialize products developed through research and development efforts and, therefore, could have a negative impact on \\nnet operating revenues. In addition, we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated \\nconfidential information belonging to us, our current or former employees, our bottling partners, other customers or suppliers, \\nor consumers or other data subjects, and may become exposed to legal action and increased regulatory oversight, including \\ngovernmental investigations, enforcement actions and regulatory fines. The Company could also be required to spend \\nsignificant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a cybersecurity incident or to repair or replace \\nnetworks and information systems. These risks are also present with respect to our bottling partners, distributors, joint venture \\npartners and suppliers that generally use separate information systems, not integrated with the information systems of the \\nCompany, and that have cybersecurity programs and processes that differ in scope and complexity from our overall \\ncybersecurity programs and processes. While we have established a third-party risk management program to address security \\nrisks, including relating to our bottling partners, our ability to monitor their security measures is limited, and we may \\nexperience secondary contractual, regulatory financial and reputational harm as a result of cybersecurity attacks, phishing \\nattacks, viruses, malware, ransomware, hacking or similar breaches experienced by our bottling partners. These risks may also \\nbe present to the extent a business or bottler we have acquired, but which does not use our information systems, experiences \\nsevere damage, a system shutdown, service disruption or a cybersecurity incident.\\nLike most major corporations, the Company’s information systems are a target of attacks. In addition, third-party providers of \\ndata hosting or cloud services, as well as our bottling partners, distributors, joint venture partners, suppliers or acquired \\nbusinesses that use separate information systems, may experience cybersecurity incidents that may involve data we share with \\nthem. Although the cybersecurity incidents that we have experienced to date, as well as those reported to us by our third-party \\npartners, have not had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, such incidents could have a \\nmaterial adverse effect on us in the future. In order to address risks to our information systems, we continue to make \\ninvestments in personnel, technologies and training. Data protection laws and regulations around the world often require \\n“reasonable,” “appropriate” or “adequate” technical and organizational security measures, and the interpretation and application \\nof those laws and regulations are often uncertain and evolving; there can be no assurance that our security measures will be \\ndeemed adequate, appropriate or reasonable by a regulator or court. Moreover, even security measures that are deemed \\nadequate, appropriate, reasonable or in accordance with applicable legal requirements may not protect the information we \\nmaintain against increasingly sophisticated attacks. In addition to potential fines, we could be subject to mandatory corrective \\naction due to a cybersecurity incident, which could adversely affect our business operations and result in substantial costs for \\nyears to come. While we have purchased cybersecurity insurance, there are no assurances that the coverage would be adequate \\nin relation to any incurred losses. Moreover, as cyberattacks increase in frequency and magnitude, we may be unable to obtain \\ncybersecurity insurance in types and amounts we view as appropriate for our operations.\\nIf we fail to comply with privacy and data protection laws, we could be subject to adverse publicity, business disruption, data \\nloss, government enforcement actions and/or private litigation, any of which could negatively affect our business and \\noperating results. \\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we receive, process, transmit and store information relating to identifiable individuals \\n(“personal data”), including employees, former employees, vendors, third-party personnel, customers and consumers with \\nwhom we interact. As a result, we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in \\nnumerous jurisdictions regarding privacy and data protection. These privacy and data protection laws may include different \\nstandards and obligations or may be interpreted and applied differently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may create \\ninconsistent or conflicting requirements. In addition, new legislation in this area may be enacted in other jurisdictions at any \\ntime or may revise the law in jurisdictions that already have privacy regulations. These laws impose operational requirements \\n23\\nfor companies receiving or processing personal data, and many provide for significant penalties for noncompliance. Some laws \\nand regulations also impose obligations regarding cross-border data transfers of personal data. These requirements with respect \\nto personal data have subjected and may continue in the future to subject the Company to, among other things, additional costs \\nand expenses and have required and may in the future require costly changes to our business practices and information \\ntechnology and security systems, policies, procedures and practices. In addition, some countries are considering or have enacted \\ndata localization or residency laws, which require that certain data be maintained, stored and/or processed within their country \\nof origin. Maintaining local data centers in individual countries could increase our operating costs significantly. Our security \\ncontrols over personal data, the training of employees and vendors on data privacy and data security, and the policies, \\nprocedures and practices we have implemented or may implement in the future may not prevent the improper disclosure of \\npersonal data by us or the third-party service providers and vendors whose technology, systems and services we use in \\nconnection with the receipt, storage and transmission of personal data. Our bottling partners, distributors, joint venture partners \\nand suppliers have privacy and security controls and policies over personal data that differ in scope and complexity from our \\npolicies, procedures and practices, and we may also experience secondary contractual, regulatory, financial and reputational \\nharm as a result of improper disclosure of personal data by our bottling partners. Unauthorized access to or improper disclosure \\nof personal data in violation of privacy and data protection laws could harm our reputation, cause loss of consumer confidence, \\nsubject us to regulatory enforcement actions (including penalties, fines and investigations), and result in private litigation \\nagainst us, which could result in loss of revenue, increased costs, liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal \\nprosecution, all of which could negatively affect our business and operating results. We have incurred, and will continue to \\nincur, expenses to comply with privacy and data protection standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry \\nstandards and contractual obligations. Increased regulation of data collection, use, disclosure and retention practices, including \\nself-regulation and industry standards, changes in existing laws and regulations, enactment of new laws and regulations, \\nincreased enforcement activity, and changes in interpretation of laws, could increase our cost of compliance and operation, limit \\nour ability to grow our business or otherwise harm our business.\\nRISKS RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL FACTORS \\nOur business is subject to evolving sustainability regulatory requirements and expectations, which exposes us to increased \\ncosts and legal and reputational risks.\\nWe have established and publicly announced sustainability goals and aspirations. We also report progress related to the circular \\neconomy of packaging; water stewardship; climate; portfolio; sustainable agriculture; human and workplace rights and \\ndiversity, equity and inclusion. These goals reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able \\nto achieve them. Our ability to achieve our sustainability goals and targets and to accurately and transparently report our \\nprogress presents numerous operational, financial, legal and other risks and is dependent on the actions of our bottling partners, \\nsuppliers and other third parties, some of which are outside of our control. If we are unable to meet our sustainability goals or \\nevolving stakeholder expectations and industry standards, or if we are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the \\ngrowing concern for sustainability issues, our reputation, and therefore our ability to sell products, could be negatively \\nimpacted. In addition, in recent years, investor advocacy groups and certain institutional investors have placed increasing \\nimportance on sustainability. If, as a result of their assessment of our sustainability practices, certain investors are unsatisfied \\nwith our actions or progress, they may reconsider their investment in our Company. At the same time, there also exists “anti-\\nESG” sentiment among certain stakeholders and government institutions, and we may face scrutiny, reputational risk, product \\nboycotts, lawsuits or market access restrictions from these parties regarding our sustainability initiatives. \\nIncreasing focus on sustainability matters has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, evolving legal and regulatory \\nrequirements, including mandatory due diligence, disclosure and reporting requirements, as well as a variety of voluntary \\ndisclosure frameworks and standards. We have incurred, and are likely to continue to incur, increased costs complying with \\nsuch standards and regulations, particularly given the lack of convergence among standards. In addition, our processes and \\ncontrols may not always comply with evolving standards and regulations for identifying, measuring and reporting sustainability \\nmetrics; our interpretation of reporting standards and regulations may differ from those of others; and such standards and \\nregulations may change over time, any of which could result in significant revisions to our goals or reported progress in \\nachieving such goals. In addition, methodologies for reporting our data may be updated and previously reported data may be \\nadjusted to reflect improvement in availability and quality of third-party data, changing assumptions, changes in the nature and \\nscope of our operations (including from acquisitions and divestitures), and other changes in circumstances. Any failure or \\nperceived failure, whether or not valid, to pursue or fulfill our sustainability goals and aspirations or to satisfy various \\nsustainability reporting standards or regulatory requirements within the timelines we announce, or at all, could increase the risk \\nof litigation or result in regulatory actions.\\nIncreasing concerns about the environmental impact of plastic bottles and other packaging materials could result in reduced \\ndemand for our beverage products and increased production and distribution costs. \\nThere are increasing concerns among consumers, governments and other stakeholders about the damaging impact of the \\naccumulation of plastic bottles and other packaging materials in the environment, particularly in the world’s waterways, lakes \\n24\\nand oceans, as well as inefficient use of resources when packaging materials are not included in a circular economy. We and our \\nbottling partners sell certain of our beverage products in plastic bottles and use other packaging materials that, while largely \\nrecyclable, may not be regularly recovered and recycled due to lack of collection and recycling infrastructure. If we and our \\nbottling partners do not, or are perceived not to, act responsibly to address plastic materials recoverability and recycling \\nconcerns and associated waste management issues, our corporate image and brand reputation could be damaged, which may \\ncause some consumers to reduce or discontinue consumption of some of our beverage products. In addition, from time to time \\nwe establish and publicly announce goals and targets to reduce the Coca-Cola system’s impact on the environment by, for \\nexample, increasing our use of recycled content in our packaging materials; increasing our use of packaging materials that are \\nmade in part of plant-based renewable materials; expanding our use of reusable packaging (including refillable or returnable \\nglass and plastic bottles, as well as dispensed and fountain delivery models where consumers use refillable containers for our \\nbeverages); participating in programs and initiatives to reclaim or recover bottles and other packaging materials that are already \\nin the environment; and taking other actions and participating in other programs and initiatives organized or sponsored by \\nnongovernmental organizations and other groups. If we and our bottling partners fail to achieve or improperly report on our \\nprogress toward achieving our announced environmental goals and targets, the resulting negative publicity could adversely \\naffect consumer preference for our products. In addition, in response to environmental concerns, governmental entities in the \\nUnited States and in many other jurisdictions around the world have adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations and \\npolicies designed to mandate or encourage plastic packaging waste reduction and an increase in recycling rates and/or recycled \\ncontent minimums, or, in some cases, restrict or even prohibit the use of certain plastic containers or packaging materials. These \\nregulations and policies, whatever their scope or form, could increase the cost of our beverage products or otherwise put the \\nCompany at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, our increased focus on reducing plastic containers and other packaging \\nmaterials waste has in the past and may continue to require us or our bottling partners to incur additional expenses and to \\nincrease our capital expenditures. A reduction in consumer demand for our products and/or an increase in costs and \\nexpenditures relating to production and distribution as a result of these environmental concerns regarding plastic bottles and \\nother packaging materials could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. \\nWater scarcity and poor quality could negatively impact the Coca-Cola system’s costs and capacity. \\nWater is a main ingredient in substantially all of our products, is vital to the production of the agricultural ingredients on which \\nour business relies and is needed in our manufacturing process. It also is critical to the prosperity of the communities we serve \\nand the ecosystems in which we operate. Water is a limited resource in many parts of the world, facing unprecedented \\nchallenges from overexploitation, increasing demand for food and other consumer and industrial products whose manufacturing \\nprocesses require water, increasing pollution and emerging awareness of potential contaminants, poor management, lack of \\nphysical or financial access to water, sociopolitical tensions due to lack of public infrastructure in certain areas of the world and \\nthe effects of climate change. As the demand for water continues to increase around the world, and as water becomes scarcer \\nand the quality of available water deteriorates, the Coca-Cola system may incur higher costs or face capacity constraints and the \\npossibility of reputational damage, which could adversely affect our profitability. \\nIncreased demand for food products, decreased agricultural productivity and increased regulation of ingredient sourcing \\ndue diligence may negatively affect our business. \\nAs part of the manufacture of our beverage products, we and our bottling partners use a number of key ingredients that are \\nderived from agricultural commodities such as sugarcane, corn, sugar beets, citrus, coffee and tea. Increased demand for food \\nproducts; decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions of the world as a result of changing weather patterns; loss of \\nbiodiversity; increased agricultural regulations, including regulation of ingredient sourcing due diligence; and other factors have \\nin the past, and may in the future, limit the availability and/or increase the cost of such agricultural commodities and could \\nimpact the food security of communities around the world. If we are unable to implement programs focused on economic \\nopportunity and environmental sustainability to address these agricultural challenges and fail to make a strategic impact on food \\nsecurity through joint efforts with bottlers, farmers, communities, suppliers and key partners, as well as through our increased \\nand continued investment in sustainable agriculture, our ability to source raw materials for use in our manufacturing processes \\nand the affordability of our products and ultimately our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted. \\nClimate change and legal or regulatory responses thereto may have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results \\nof operations. \\nThere is increasing concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures due to increased concentration of carbon \\ndioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is causing significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and \\nan increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions of the world \\nas a result of changing weather patterns may limit the availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities, such as \\nsugarcane, corn, sugar beets, citrus, coffee and tea, which are important ingredients for our products, and could impact the food \\nsecurity of communities around the world. Climate change may also exacerbate extreme weather, resulting in water scarcity or \\nflooding, and cause a further deterioration of water quality in affected regions, which could limit water availability for the \\nCoca-Cola system’s bottling operations. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair \\n25\\nproduction capabilities, disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products. Increasing concern over climate change \\nalso may result in additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to reduce or mitigate the effects of carbon dioxide and \\nother greenhouse gas emissions on the environment, and/or may result in increased disclosure obligations. Increased energy or \\ncompliance costs and expenses due to increased legal or regulatory requirements may cause disruptions in, or an increase in the \\ncosts associated with, the manufacturing and distribution of our beverage products. The physical effects and transition costs of \\nclimate change and legal, regulatory or market initiatives to address climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on \\nour business and results of operations. In addition, from time to time we establish and publicly announce goals and targets to \\nreduce the Coca-Cola system’s carbon footprint by increasing our use of recycled packaging materials, expanding our \\nrenewable energy usage, and participating in environmental and sustainability programs and initiatives organized or sponsored \\nby nongovernmental organizations and other groups to reduce greenhouse gas emissions industrywide. If we and our bottling \\npartners fail to achieve or improperly report on our progress toward achieving our carbon footprint reduction goals and targets, \\nthe resulting negative publicity could adversely affect consumer preference for our beverage products. \\nAdverse weather conditions could reduce the demand for our products. \\nThe sales of our products are influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate. Unusually \\ncold or rainy weather during the summer months may have a temporary effect on the demand for our products and contribute to \\nlower sales, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations for such periods. \\nITEM 1B.  UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\\nNot applicable.\\nITEM 1C.  CYBERSECURITY\\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\\nWe face various cyber risks, including, but not limited to, risks related to unauthorized access, misuse, data theft, computer \\nviruses, system disruptions, ransomware, malicious software and other intrusions. We utilize a multilayered, proactive approach \\nto identify, evaluate, mitigate and prevent potential cyber and information security threats through our cybersecurity risk \\nmanagement program. Our cybersecurity risk management program is integrated into our broader Enterprise Risk Management \\n(“ERM”) program, which is designed to identify, assess, prioritize and mitigate risks across the organization to enhance our \\nresilience and support the achievement of our strategic objectives. This integrated approach helps ensure that cyber risks are not \\nviewed in isolation, but are assessed, prioritized and managed in alignment with the Company’s operational, financial and \\nstrategic risks, assisting the Company in more effectively managing interdependencies among risks and enhancing risk \\nmitigation strategies.\\nWe devote significant resources to protecting the security of our computer systems, software, networks and other technology \\nassets. Our efforts are designed to adapt with the evolution of information security risks and appropriate best practices and \\ninclude physical, administrative and technical safeguards. Our practices are generally developed from, and benchmarked \\nagainst, recognized cybersecurity frameworks, such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity \\nFramework. Our newly acquired businesses and consolidated bottling operations maintain separate cybersecurity programs and \\nprocesses that may differ in scope and complexity from the Company’s overall cybersecurity programs and processes. \\nHowever, for all consolidated entities, our cybersecurity risk management program is designed to help coordinate the \\nCompany’s identification of, response to and recovery from, cybersecurity incidents and includes processes to triage, assess the \\nseverity of, escalate, contain, investigate and remediate incidents, as well as to comply with applicable legal obligations. \\nOur internal audit team assesses the effectiveness of our internal controls relating to cybersecurity. Our management team also \\nengages certain outside advisors and consultants to assist in the identification, oversight, evaluation and management of \\ncybersecurity risks on a regular basis, as well as to advise on specific topics. For example, we conduct tests that help discover \\npotential vulnerabilities, including external penetration testing and tabletop and other exercises, to evaluate our core information \\nsystems and cybersecurity practices that enable improved decision-making and prioritization, as well as to promote monitoring \\nand reporting across compliance functions. As part of our overall risk mitigation strategy, the Company also maintains cyber \\ninsurance coverage; however, such insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to \\nsecurity breaches, cyberattacks and other related breaches.\\nIn order to oversee and identify risks from cybersecurity threats associated with the Company’s independent bottling partners, \\ndistributors, wholesalers, retailers and other business partners, as well as our use of third-party service providers, we maintain a \\nthird-party risk management program designed to help protect against the misuse of information technology. We have various \\nprocesses and procedures to evaluate cybersecurity threats associated with third parties, including requiring key third-party \\nservice providers to complete initial and periodic security assessments. In addition, our Global Chief Information Security \\nOfficer (“CISO”) and other senior leaders regularly meet with key bottling partners to discuss cybersecurity risks and \\n26\\nmitigation programs in order to advance risk management capabilities and proactively share cybersecurity guidelines and best \\npractices. \\nWe have not identified any cybersecurity threats that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our \\nbusiness strategy, results of our operations, or financial condition. However, we have been the target of cyber attacks and \\nexpect them to continue as cybersecurity threats have been rapidly evolving in sophistication and becoming more prevalent in \\nthe industry. We cannot eliminate all risks from cybersecurity threats or provide assurances that we have not experienced an \\nundetected cybersecurity incident in the past or that we will not experience such an incident in the future. For more information \\non the risks from cybersecurity threats that we face, refer to Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”\\nCybersecurity Governance and Oversight\\nThe Company’s cybersecurity risk management program is supervised by our CISO, who reports directly to the Company’s \\nChief Information Officer (“CIO”). The CISO and his team are responsible for leading enterprise-wide cybersecurity strategy, \\npolicy, standards, architecture and processes. Our current CISO received his Master of Business Administration degree from \\nColumbia University and has over 20 years of cybersecurity experience, including relevant prior senior leadership positions \\nheld with three other large companies.\\nThe CISO chairs the Company’s Cybersecurity Oversight Council, a cross-functional management committee that drives \\nawareness, ownership and alignment across broad governance and risk stakeholder groups for effective cybersecurity risk \\nmanagement. The Cybersecurity Oversight Council is sponsored by the Company’s Global General Counsel and CIO and is \\ncomposed of senior leaders from our privacy, legal, information technology, cybersecurity, internal audit and global security \\nand asset protection functions, among others. Subject matter experts are also invited, as appropriate. The Cybersecurity \\nOversight Council meets at least quarterly and has responsibility for oversight and validation of the Company’s cybersecurity \\nstrategic direction, risks and threats, priorities, resource allocation, capabilities and planning. The Cybersecurity Oversight \\nCouncil acts in alignment with the Company’s Risk Steering Committee, another cross-functional management committee, \\nwhich provides strategic direction and oversight over the Company’s ERM program. The CISO and his team, as well as the \\nCybersecurity Oversight Council, are informed about and monitor the prevention, detection, mitigation and remediation of \\ncybersecurity incidents in accordance with the Company’s cyber incident response plan.\\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is charged with oversight of cybersecurity matters and receives regular reports \\nfrom the CISO and the CIO on, among other things, the Company’s cyber risks and threats, the status of projects to strengthen \\nthe Company’s information security systems, assessments of the Company’s security program and the emerging threat \\nlandscape. In accordance with our cyber incident response plan, the Audit Committee is promptly informed by management of \\ncybersecurity incidents with the potential to materially adversely affect the Company or its information systems and is regularly \\nupdated about incidents with lesser impact potential. The Chair of the Audit Committee regularly briefs the full Board on these \\nmatters. In addition, the Board also periodically receives cybersecurity updates directly from management. \\nIn an effort to detect and defend against cyber threats, the Company annually provides its employees with various cybersecurity \\nand data protection training programs. These programs cover timely and relevant topics, including social engineering, phishing, \\npassword protection, confidential data protection, asset use and mobile security, and educate employees on the importance of \\nreporting all incidents promptly to the Company’s centrally managed cyber defense and security operations. \\nITEM 2.  PROPERTIES\\nOur worldwide headquarters is located on a 35-acre complex in Atlanta, Georgia. The complex includes several office buildings \\nwhich are used by Corporate employees and North America operating segment employees. In addition, the complex includes \\ntechnical and engineering facilities along with a reception center. \\nWe own or lease additional facilities, real estate and office space throughout the world, which we use for administrative, \\nmanufacturing, processing, packaging, storage, warehousing, distribution and retail operations. These properties are generally \\nincluded in the geographic operating segment in which they are located, with the exception of our Costa retail stores, which are \\nincluded in the Global Ventures operating segment, and facilities related to our consolidated bottling and distribution \\noperations, which are included in the Bottling Investments operating segment. \\n27\\nThe following table summarizes our principal production facilities, distribution and storage facilities, and retail stores by \\noperating segment and Corporate as of December 31, 2023:\\nPrincipal Concentrate \\nand/or Syrup Plants\\nPrincipal Beverage \\nManufacturing/\\nBottling Plants\\nPrincipal Distribution \\nand Storage Facilities\\nPrincipal Retail Stores\\nOwned\\nLeased\\nOwned\\nLeased\\nOwned\\nLeased\\nOwned\\nLeased\\nEurope, Middle East & Africa\\n \\n5  \\n— \\n \\n2  \\n—  \\n7  \\n27  \\n—  \\n13 \\nLatin America\\n \\n5  \\n— \\n \\n—  \\n—  \\n2  \\n6  \\n—  \\n— \\nNorth America\\n \\n10  \\n— \\n \\n6  \\n3  \\n—  \\n39  \\n—  \\n5 \\nAsia Pacific\\n \\n7  \\n— \\n \\n3  \\n—  \\n3  \\n4  \\n—  \\n— \\nGlobal Ventures\\n \\n1  \\n— \\n \\n2  \\n—  \\n—  \\n8  \\n—  \\n1,575 \\nBottling Investments\\n \\n—  \\n— \\n \\n81  \\n4  \\n104  \\n112  \\n—  \\n— \\nCorporate\\n \\n3  \\n— \\n \\n—  \\n—  \\n—  \\n5  \\n—  \\n— \\nTotal\\n \\n31  \\n— \\n \\n94  \\n7  \\n116  \\n201  \\n—  \\n1,593 \\nManagement believes that our Company’s facilities used for the production of our products are suitable and adequate, that they \\nare being appropriately utilized in line with past experience, and that they have sufficient production capacity for their present \\nintended purposes. The extent of utilization of our production facilities varies based upon seasonal demand for our products. \\nHowever, management believes that, with the exception of certain dairy products that require specialized equipment, additional \\nproduction can be achieved at the existing facilities by adding personnel and capital equipment or, at some facilities, by adding \\nshifts of personnel or expanding the facilities. The Company is in the process of increasing our dairy production capacity. We \\ncontinuously review our anticipated requirements for facilities and, on the basis of that review, may from time to time acquire \\nor lease additional facilities and/or dispose of existing facilities.\\nITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\\nThe Company is involved in various legal proceedings, including the proceedings specifically discussed below. Management\\nbelieves that, except as disclosed in “U.S. Federal Income Tax Dispute” below, the total liabilities of the Company that may \\narise as a result of currently pending legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company taken as a whole.\\nAqua-Chem Litigation\\nOn December 20, 2002, the Company filed a lawsuit (The Coca-Cola Company v. Aqua-Chem, Inc., Civil Action No. \\n2002CV631-50) in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia (“Georgia Case”), seeking a declaratory judgment that the \\nCompany has no obligation to its former subsidiary, Aqua-Chem, Inc., now known as Cleaver-Brooks, Inc. (“Aqua-Chem”), for \\nany past, present or future liabilities or expenses in connection with any claims or lawsuits against Aqua-Chem. Subsequent to \\nthe Company’s filing but on the same day, Aqua-Chem filed a lawsuit (Aqua-Chem, Inc. v. The Coca-Cola Company, Civil \\nAction No. 02CV012179) in the Circuit Court, Civil Division of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin (“Wisconsin Case”). In the \\nWisconsin Case, Aqua-Chem sought a declaratory judgment that the Company is responsible for all liabilities and expenses not \\ncovered by insurance in connection with certain of Aqua-Chem’s general and product liability claims arising from occurrences \\nprior to the Company’s sale of Aqua-Chem in 1981, and a judgment for breach of contract in an amount exceeding $9 million \\nfor costs incurred by Aqua-Chem to date in connection with such claims. The Wisconsin Case initially was stayed, pending \\nfinal resolution of the Georgia Case, and later was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice by Aqua-Chem. \\nThe Company owned Aqua-Chem from 1970 to 1981. During that time, the Company purchased over $400 million of insurance \\ncoverage, which also insures Aqua-Chem for some of its prior and future costs for certain product liability and other claims. \\nThe Company sold Aqua-Chem to Lyonnaise American Holding, Inc., in 1981 under the terms of a stock sale agreement. The \\n1981 agreement, and a subsequent 1983 settlement agreement, outlined the parties’ rights and obligations concerning past and \\nfuture claims and lawsuits involving Aqua-Chem. Cleaver-Brooks, a division of Aqua-Chem, manufactured boilers, some of \\nwhich contained asbestos gaskets. Aqua-Chem was first named as a defendant in asbestos lawsuits in or around 1985 and \\ncurrently has approximately 15,000 active claims pending against it.\\nThe parties agreed in 2004 to stay the Georgia Case pending the outcome of insurance coverage litigation filed by certain Aqua-\\nChem insurers on March 26, 2004. In the coverage action, five plaintiff insurance companies filed suit (Century Indemnity \\nCompany, et al. v. Aqua-Chem, Inc., The Coca-Cola Company, et al., Case No. 04CV002852) in the Circuit Court, Civil \\nDivision of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, against the Company, Aqua-Chem and 16 insurance companies. Several of the \\npolicies that were the subject of the coverage action had been issued to the Company during the period (1970 to 1981) when the \\nCompany owned Aqua-Chem. The complaint sought a determination of the respective rights and obligations under the \\ninsurance policies issued with regard to asbestos-related claims against Aqua-Chem. The action also sought a monetary \\n28\\njudgment reimbursing any amounts paid by the plaintiffs in excess of their obligations. Two of the insurers, one with a \\n$15 million policy limit and one with a $25 million policy limit, asserted cross-claims against the Company, alleging that the \\nCompany and/or its insurers are responsible for Aqua-Chem’s asbestos liabilities before any obligation is triggered on the part \\nof the cross-claimant insurers to pay for such costs under their policies.\\nAqua-Chem and the Company filed and obtained a partial summary judgment determination in the coverage action that the \\ninsurers for Aqua-Chem and the Company were jointly and severally liable for coverage amounts, but reserving judgment on \\nother defenses that might apply. During the course of the Wisconsin insurance coverage litigation, Aqua-Chem and the \\nCompany reached settlements with several of the insurers, including plaintiffs, who paid funds into escrow accounts for \\npayment of costs arising from the asbestos claims against Aqua-Chem. On July 24, 2007, the Wisconsin trial court entered a \\nfinal declaratory judgment regarding the rights and obligations of the parties under the insurance policies issued by the \\nremaining defendant insurers, which judgment was not appealed. The judgment directs, among other things, that each insurer \\nwhose policy is triggered is jointly and severally liable for 100% of Aqua-Chem’s losses up to policy limits. The court’s \\njudgment concluded the Wisconsin insurance coverage litigation. \\nThe Company and Aqua-Chem continued to pursue and obtain coverage agreements for the asbestos-related claims against \\nAqua-Chem with those insurance companies that did not settle in the Wisconsin insurance coverage litigation. The Company \\nanticipated that a final settlement with three of those insurers (“Chartis insurers”) would be finalized in May 2011, but the \\nChartis insurers repudiated their settlement commitments and, as a result, Aqua-Chem and the Company filed suit against them \\nin Wisconsin state court to enforce the coverage-in-place settlement or, in the alternative, to obtain a declaratory judgment \\nvalidating Aqua-Chem and the Company’s interpretation of the court’s judgment in the Wisconsin insurance coverage \\nlitigation. \\nIn February 2012, the parties filed and argued a number of cross-motions for summary judgment related to the issues of the \\nenforceability of the settlement agreement and the exhaustion of policies underlying those of the Chartis insurers. The court \\ngranted defendants’ motions for summary judgment that the 2011 Settlement Agreement and 2010 Term Sheet were not \\nbinding contracts, but denied their similar motions related to plaintiffs’ claims for promissory and/or equitable estoppel. On or \\nabout May 15, 2012, the parties entered into a mutually agreeable settlement/stipulation resolving two major issues: exhaustion \\nof underlying coverage and control of defense. On or about January 10, 2013, the parties reached a settlement of the estoppel \\nclaims and all of the remaining coverage issues, with the exception of one disputed issue relating to the scope of the Chartis \\ninsurers’ defense obligations in two policy years. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the Company and \\nAqua-Chem on that one open issue and entered a final appealable judgment to that effect following the parties’ settlement. On \\nJanuary 23, 2013, the Chartis insurers filed a notice of appeal of the trial court’s summary judgment ruling. On October 29, \\n2013, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the Company and Aqua-Chem. On \\nNovember 27, 2013, the Chartis insurers filed a petition for review in the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, and on December 11, \\n2013, the Company filed its opposition to that petition. On April 16, 2014, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin denied the Chartis \\ninsurers’ petition for review. \\nThe Georgia Case remains subject to the stay agreed to in 2004. \\nU.S. Federal Income Tax Dispute\\nOn September 17, 2015, the Company received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (“Notice”) from the IRS seeking \\napproximately $3.3 billion of additional federal income tax for years 2007 through 2009. In the Notice, the IRS stated its intent \\nto reallocate over $9 billion of income to the U.S. parent company from certain of its foreign affiliates that the U.S. parent \\ncompany licensed to manufacture, distribute, sell, market and promote its products in certain non-U.S. markets.\\nThe Notice concerned the Company’s transfer pricing between its U.S. parent company and certain of its foreign affiliates. IRS \\nrules governing transfer pricing require arm’s-length pricing of transactions between related parties such as the Company’s U.S. \\nparent and its foreign affiliates.\\nTo resolve the same transfer pricing issue for the tax years 1987 through 1995, the Company and the IRS had agreed in 1996 on \\nan arm’s-length methodology for determining the amount of U.S. taxable income that the U.S. parent company would report as \\ncompensation from its foreign licensees. The Company and the IRS memorialized this accord in a closing agreement resolving \\nthat dispute (“Closing Agreement”). The Closing Agreement provided that, absent a change in material facts or circumstances \\nor relevant federal tax law, in calculating the Company’s income taxes going forward, the Company would not be assessed \\npenalties by the IRS for using the agreed-upon tax calculation methodology that the Company and the IRS agreed would be \\nused for the 1987 through 1995 tax years.\\nThe IRS audited and confirmed the Company’s compliance with the agreed-upon Closing Agreement methodology in five \\nsuccessive audit cycles for tax years 1996 through 2006.\\n29\\nThe September 17, 2015, Notice from the IRS retroactively rejected the previously agreed-upon methodology for the 2007 \\nthrough 2009 tax years in favor of an entirely different methodology, without prior notice to the Company. Using the new tax \\ncalculation methodology, the IRS reallocated over $9 billion of income to the U.S. parent company from its foreign licensees \\nfor tax years 2007 through 2009. Consistent with the Closing Agreement, the IRS did not assert penalties, and it has yet           \\nto do so.\\nThe IRS designated the Company’s matter for litigation on October 15, 2015. Litigation designation is an IRS determination \\nthat forecloses to a company any and all alternative means for resolution of a tax dispute. As a result of the IRS’ designation of \\nthe Company’s matter for litigation, the Company was forced to either accept the IRS’ newly imposed tax assessment and pay \\nthe full amount of the asserted tax or litigate the matter in the federal courts. The matter remains subject to the IRS’ litigation \\ndesignation, preventing the Company from any attempt to settle or otherwise mutually resolve the matter with the IRS.\\nThe Company consequently initiated litigation by filing a petition in the Tax Court in December 2015, challenging the tax \\nadjustments enumerated in the Notice.\\nPrior to trial, the IRS increased its transfer pricing adjustment by $385 million, resulting in an additional tax adjustment of \\n$135 million. The Company obtained a summary judgment in its favor on a different matter related to Mexican foreign tax \\ncredits, which thereafter effectively reduced the IRS’ potential tax adjustment by $138 million.\\nThe trial was held in the Tax Court from March through May 2018, and final post-trial briefs were filed and exchanged in April \\n2019.\\nOn November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued the Opinion in which it predominantly sided with the IRS but agreed with the \\nCompany that dividends previously paid by the foreign licensees to the U.S. parent company in reliance upon the Closing \\nAgreement should continue to be allowed to offset royalties, including those that would become payable to the Company in \\naccordance with the Opinion. On November 8, 2023, the Tax Court issued a supplemental opinion, siding with the IRS in \\nconcluding both that the blocked-income regulations apply to the Company’s operations and that the Tax Court opinion in     \\n3M Co. & Subs. v. Commissioner (February 9, 2023) controlled as to the validity of those regulations.\\nThe Company believes that the IRS and the Tax Court misinterpreted and misapplied the applicable regulations in reallocating \\nincome earned by the Company’s foreign licensees to increase the Company’s U.S. tax. Moreover, the Company believes that \\nthe retroactive imposition of such tax liability using a calculation methodology different from that previously agreed upon by \\nthe IRS and the Company, and audited by the IRS for over a decade, is unconstitutional. The Company intends to assert its \\nclaims on appeal and vigorously defend its position.\\nIn determining the amount of tax reserve to be recorded as of December 31, 2020, the Company completed the required two-\\nstep evaluation process prescribed by Accounting Standards Codification 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. In doing so, we \\nconsulted with outside advisors, and we reviewed and considered relevant laws, rules, and regulations, including, but not \\nlimited to, the Opinions and relevant caselaw. We also considered our intention to vigorously defend our positions and assert \\nour various well-founded legal claims via every available avenue of appeal. We concluded, based on the technical and legal \\nmerits of the Company’s tax positions, that it is more likely than not the Company’s tax positions will ultimately be sustained \\non appeal. In addition, we considered a number of alternative transfer pricing methodologies, including the methodology \\nasserted by the IRS and affirmed in the Opinions (“Tax Court Methodology”), that could be applied by the courts upon final \\nresolution of the litigation. Based on the required probability analysis, we determined the methodologies we believe the federal \\ncourts could ultimately order to be used in calculating the Company’s tax. As a result of this analysis, we recorded a tax reserve \\nof $438 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the application of the resulting methodologies as well as \\nthe different tax treatment applicable to dividends originally paid to the U.S. parent company by its foreign licensees, in \\nreliance upon the Closing Agreement, that would be recharacterized as royalties in accordance with the Opinions and the \\nCompany’s analysis.\\nThe Company’s conclusion that it is more likely than not the Company’s tax positions will ultimately be sustained on appeal is \\nunchanged as of December 31, 2023. However, we updated our calculation of the methodologies we believe the federal courts \\ncould ultimately order to be used in calculating the Company’s tax. As a result of the application of the required probability \\nanalysis to these updated calculations and the accrual of interest through the current reporting period, we updated our tax \\nreserve as of December 31, 2023 to $439 million.\\nWhile the Company strongly disagrees with the IRS’ positions and the portions of the Opinions affirming such positions, it is \\npossible that some portion or all of the adjustment proposed by the IRS and sustained by the Tax Court could ultimately be \\nupheld. In that event, the Company would likely be subject to significant additional liabilities for tax years 2007 through 2009, \\nand potentially also for subsequent years, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position, \\nresults of operations and cash flows.\\nThe Company calculated the potential impact of applying the Tax Court Methodology to reallocate income from foreign \\nlicensees potentially covered within the scope of the Opinions, assuming such methodology were to be ultimately upheld by the \\n30\\ncourts, and the IRS were to decide to apply that methodology to subsequent years, with consent of the federal courts. This \\nimpact would include taxes and interest accrued through December 31, 2023 for the 2007 through 2009 litigated tax years and \\nfor subsequent tax years from 2010 through 2023. The calculations incorporated the estimated impact of correlative adjustments \\nto the previously accrued transition tax payable under the Tax Reform Act. The Company estimates that the potential aggregate \\nincremental tax and interest liability could be approximately $16 billion as of December 31, 2023. Additional income tax and \\ninterest would continue to accrue until the time any such potential liability, or portion thereof, were to be paid. We currently \\nproject the continued application of the Tax Court Methodology in future years, assuming similar facts and circumstances as of \\nDecember 31, 2023, would result in an incremental annual tax liability that would increase the Company’s effective tax rate by \\napproximately 3.5%.\\nThe Company and the IRS are now in the process of agreeing on the tax impacts of the Opinions. Subsequent to the completion \\nof this process, the Tax Court will render a decision in the case. The Company will have 90 days thereafter to file a notice of \\nappeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. The IRS will then seek to collect, and the Company expects to \\npay, any additional tax related to the 2007 through 2009 tax years reflected in the Tax Court decision (and interest thereon). The \\nCompany currently estimates that the payment to be made at that time related to the 2007 through 2009 tax years, which is \\nincluded in the above estimate of the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability, would be approximately \\n$5.8 billion (including interest accrued through December 31, 2023), plus any additional interest accrued through the time of \\npayment. Some or all of this amount, plus accrued interest, would be refunded if the Company were to prevail on appeal.\\nITEM 4.  MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\\nNot applicable.\\nITEM X.

We own or license and market numerous beverage brands, \\nwhich we group into the following categories: Trademark Coca-Cola; sparkling flavors; water, sports, coffee and tea; juice, \\nvalue-added dairy and plant-based beverages; and emerging beverages. We own and market several of the world’s largest \\nnonalcoholic sparkling soft drink brands, including Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and Diet Coke/Coca-Cola \\nLight.\\nWe make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of independent \\nbottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and retailers as well as the Company’s consolidated bottling and distribution \\noperations. Beverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to us account for 2.2 billion of the estimated 64 billion servings \\nof all beverages consumed worldwide every day.\\nWe believe our success depends on our ability to connect with consumers by providing them with a wide variety of beverage \\noptions to meet their desires, needs and lifestyles. Our success further depends on the ability of our people to execute \\neffectively, every day.\\nOur Company operates in two lines of business: concentrate operations and finished product operations.\\nOur concentrate operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as \\n“beverage bases,” syrups, including fountain syrups, and certain finished beverages to authorized bottling operations (to which \\nwe typically refer as our “bottlers” or our “bottling partners”). Our bottling partners either combine concentrates with still or \\nsparkling water and sweeteners (depending on the product), or combine syrups with still or sparkling water, to produce finished \\nbeverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers, such as cans and refillable and nonrefillable glass and \\nplastic bottles, bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, \\nthrough wholesalers or other bottlers. In addition, outside the United States, our bottling partners are typically authorized to \\nmanufacture fountain syrups, using our concentrates, which they sell to fountain retailers for use in producing beverages for \\nimmediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain \\nretailers. Our concentrate operations are included in our geographic operating segments and our Global Ventures operating \\nsegment.\\nOur finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling soft drinks and a variety of other finished \\nbeverages to retailers, or to distributors and wholesalers who in turn sell the beverages to retailers. Generally, finished product \\noperations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations. These operations \\nconsist primarily of our consolidated bottling and distribution operations, which are included in our Bottling Investments \\noperating segment. In certain markets, the Company also operates non-bottling finished product operations in which we sell \\nfinished beverages to distributors and wholesalers that are generally not one of the Company’s bottling partners. These \\noperations are generally included in one of our geographic operating segments or our Global Ventures operating segment. \\nAdditionally, we sell directly to consumers through retail stores operated by Costa. These sales are included in our Global \\nVentures operating segment. In the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers, who use \\nthe fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners \\nwho in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. These fountain syrup sales are included in our North \\nAmerica operating segment. \\n35\\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of total net operating revenues attributable to concentrate operations and finished \\nproduct operations:\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\nConcentrate operations\\n 58% \\n 56% \\nFinished product operations\\n 42 \\n 44 \\nTotal\\n 100% \\n 100% \\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of total worldwide unit case volume attributable to concentrate operations and \\nfinished product operations:\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\nConcentrate operations\\n 83% \\n 82% \\nFinished product operations\\n 17 \\n 18 \\nTotal\\n 100% \\n 100% \\nWe operate in the highly competitive commercial beverage industry. We face strong competition from numerous other general \\nand specialty beverage companies. We, along with other beverage companies, are affected by a number of factors, including, \\nbut not limited to, the cost to manufacture and distribute products, consumer spending, economic conditions, availability and \\nquality of water, consumer preferences, inflation, geopolitical conditions including international conflicts, local and national \\nlaws and regulations, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, fuel prices, weather patterns and health crises. \\nDespite the dynamic world in which we are currently operating, we believe we are well positioned to create value for our \\nCompany and our stakeholders. In an effort to support our future growth, we are continuing to invest in our portfolio of brands, \\nour strategic capabilities and our people. We are focused on the following strategic priorities: unlocking the potential of our \\nportfolio of strong global, regional and scaled local brands; developing a robust innovation pipeline focusing on scalable \\ninitiatives; increasing consumer-centric marketing effectiveness and efficiency; winning in the marketplace with aligned data-\\ndriven revenue growth management and execution capabilities; and further embedding sustainability goals into our operations. \\nChallenges and Risks\\nBeing a global enterprise provides unique opportunities for our Company. Challenges and risks accompany those opportunities. \\nOur management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of our Company and the commercial \\nbeverage industry. Of these, six key strategic business challenges and risks are discussed below.\\nObesity\\nObesity continues to impact individuals, communities and countries worldwide. There is concern among consumers, public \\nhealth professionals and governments about the health problems associated with obesity. This concern represents a significant \\nchallenge to our industry. We understand that obesity is a complex public health challenge, and we are committed to being a \\npart of the solution.\\nWe recognize the uniqueness of consumers’ lifestyles and dietary choices. Therefore, we continue to:\\n• offer an expanded portfolio of beverage choices, including reduced-, low- and no-calorie beverage options; \\n• provide transparent nutrition information, featuring calories on the front of most of our packages;\\n• provide our beverages in a range of packaging sizes, including small sizes to enable portion control; and\\n• market responsibly, including no advertising targeted to children under 13.\\nThe heritage of our Company is to lead, and innovation is critical for leadership. As such, we are resolute in continuing to \\ninnovate and are committed to partnering with suppliers to invest in research and development of new noncaloric sweeteners \\nand flavors that help us create the best tasting beverages, including options with low or no calories. We want to be a helpful and \\ncredible partner in the fight against obesity. Across the Coca-Cola system, we are mobilizing our assets in marketing and in \\ncommunity outreach to increase awareness and spur action.\\nEvolving Consumer Product Preferences\\nWe are impacted by shifting consumer demographics and needs, on-the-go lifestyles and consumers who are empowered with \\nmore information than ever. As a consequence of these changes, many consumers want more beverage choices, personalization, \\na focus on sustainability, and transparency related to our products and packaging. We are committed to meeting changing \\nconsumer needs and to generating growth through our evolving portfolio of beverage brands and products (including numerous \\n36\\nlow- and no-calorie products); selectively expanding into other profitable categories of the commercial beverage industry; \\ninvesting in innovative and sustainable packaging; and including easy-to-access information about our beverages on our \\nwebsite. \\nEvolving Competitive Landscape and Competing in the Digital Marketplace \\nOur Company faces strong competition from well-established global companies as well as numerous regional and local \\ncompanies. Additionally, the rapidly evolving digital landscape and growth of e-commerce in many markets has led to dramatic \\nshifts in consumer shopping habits and patterns. Consumers are rapidly embracing shopping via mobile device applications,    \\ne-commerce retailers and e-commerce websites or platforms, which presents new challenges to maintain the competitiveness \\nand relevancy of our brands. As a result, we must continuously strengthen our capabilities in marketing and innovation to \\ncompete in a digital environment and maintain brand loyalty and market share. In addition, we are increasing our investments in \\ne-commerce to support retail and meal delivery services, offering more package sizes that are fit-for-purpose for online sales \\nand shifting more consumer and trade promotions to digital.\\nProduct Safety and Quality\\nWe strive to meet the highest standards in both product safety and product quality. We are aware that some consumers have \\nconcerns and negative viewpoints regarding certain ingredients used in our products. We only use ingredients that are \\nauthorized for use by regulatory authorities in each of the markets in which we operate. The Coca-Cola system works every day \\nto produce high-quality, safe and refreshing beverages for consumers around the world. We have rigorous product and \\ningredient safety and quality standards designed to ensure safety and quality in each of our products, and we drive innovation \\nthat provides new beverage options to satisfy consumers’ evolving needs and preferences. \\nWe work to ensure consistent safety and quality through strong governance and compliance with applicable regulations and \\nstandards. We stay current with new regulations, industry best practices and marketplace conditions, and we engage with \\nstandard-setting and industry organizations. Additionally, we manufacture and distribute our products according to strict \\npolicies, requirements and specifications set forth in an integrated quality management program that continually measures all \\noperations within the Coca-Cola system against the same stringent standards. Our quality management program also identifies \\nand mitigates risks and drives improvement. In our quality laboratories, we stringently measure the quality attributes of \\ningredients as well as samples of finished products collected from the marketplace. \\nWe perform due diligence to ensure that product and ingredient safety and quality standards are maintained in the more than \\n200 countries and territories where our products are sold. We regularly assess the relevance of our requirements and standards \\nand continually work to improve and refine them across our entire supply chain.\\nSustainability Matters\\nInvestors and stakeholders increasingly focus on sustainability matters. We acknowledge that we have a role to play in \\ndeveloping and implementing solutions that help build resilience across our business. We report our sustainability progress in \\nthe following areas: circular economy of packaging; water stewardship; climate; portfolio; sustainable agriculture; human and \\nworkplace rights and diversity, equity and inclusion. Our ability to achieve our sustainability goals is dependent on many \\nfactors, including, but not limited to, our actions along with the actions of various stakeholders, such as our bottling partners, \\nsuppliers, governments, nongovernmental organizations, communities, and other third parties, some of which are outside of our \\ncontrol.\\nTalent Acquisition and Retention\\nCompetition for existing and prospective personnel has increased, especially in light of changing worker expectations and talent \\nmarketplace variability regarding flexible work models. In addition, the broader labor market is experiencing a shortage of \\nqualified workers, which has further increased competition for qualified employees that we want and may require for our future \\nbusiness needs.  \\nOur people and our culture are critical business priorities, and we strive to be a global employer of choice that attracts and \\nretains high-performing talent with the passion, skills and mindsets to drive us on our purpose to refresh the world and make a \\ndifference. We are committed to building an equitable and inclusive culture that inspires and supports the growth of our \\nemployees, serves our communities and shapes a strong and more sustainable business. \\nSee “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in Part I of this report for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company.\\n37\\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United \\nStates (“U.S. GAAP”), which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts \\nreported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We believe our most critical accounting policies and \\nestimates relate to the following:\\n• Principles of Consolidation\\n• Recoverability of Equity Method Investments and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\\n• Pension Plan Valuations\\n• Revenue Recognition\\n• Income Taxes\\nManagement has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the \\nAudit Committee of our Company’s Board of Directors. While our estimates and assumptions are based on our knowledge of \\ncurrent events and on actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and \\nassumptions. For a discussion of the Company’s significant accounting policies, refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements.\\nPrinciples of Consolidation\\nOur Company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest. Additionally, there are \\nsituations in which consolidation is required even though the usual condition of consolidation (i.e., ownership of a majority \\nvoting interest) does not apply. Generally, this occurs when an entity holds an interest in another business enterprise that was \\nachieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests, which results in a disproportionate relationship between \\nsuch entity’s voting interests in, and its exposure to the economic risks and potential rewards of, the other business enterprise. \\nThis disproportionate relationship results in what is known as a variable interest, and the entity in which another entity holds a \\nvariable interest is referred to as a “VIE.” An enterprise must consolidate a VIE if it is determined to be the primary beneficiary \\nof the VIE. The primary beneficiary has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the \\nentity’s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could \\npotentially be significant to the VIE.\\nOur Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling operations, for which we were not determined to be the \\nprimary beneficiary. Our variable interests in these VIEs primarily relate to equity investments, profit guarantees or \\nsubordinated financial support. Refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Although these financial \\narrangements resulted in our holding variable interests in these entities, they did not empower us to direct the activities of the \\nVIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs’ economic performance. Creditors of our VIEs do not have recourse against the \\ngeneral credit of the Company, regardless of whether the VIEs are accounted for as consolidated entities.\\nWe use the equity method to account for investments in companies if our investment provides us with the ability to exercise \\nsignificant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee. Our consolidated net income includes our \\nCompany’s proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies. Our judgment regarding the level of influence \\nover each equity method investee includes considering key factors, such as our ownership interest, representation on the board \\nof directors, participation in policy-making decisions, other commercial arrangements and material intercompany transactions.\\nWe eliminate from our financial results all significant intercompany transactions, including the intercompany transactions with \\nconsolidated VIEs and the intercompany portion of transactions with equity method investees.\\nRecoverability of Equity Method Investments and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets \\nOur Company faces many uncertainties and risks related to various economic, political and regulatory environments in the \\ncountries and territories in which we operate, particularly in developing and emerging markets. Refer to the heading “Our \\nBusiness — Challenges and Risks” above and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in Part I of this report as well as the heading \\n“Operations Review” below for additional information related to our present business environment. As a result, management \\nmust make numerous assumptions, which involve a significant amount of judgment, when performing impairment tests of \\nequity method investments and indefinite-lived intangible assets in various regions around the world. The performance of \\nimpairment tests involves critical accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management judgment and include \\ninherent uncertainties. Factors that management must estimate include, among others, the economic lives of the assets, sales \\nvolume, pricing, royalty rates, cost of raw materials, delivery costs, long-term growth rates, discount rates, marketing spending, \\nforeign currency exchange rates, tax rates, capital spending and proceeds from the sale of assets. The variability of these factors \\n38\\ndepends on a number of conditions, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period. These factors are \\neven more difficult to estimate when global financial markets are highly volatile. As these factors are often interdependent and \\nmay not change in isolation, we do not believe it is practicable or meaningful to present the impact of changing a single factor. \\nIf we had used other assumptions and estimates when impairment tests were performed, impairment charges could have \\nresulted. Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions in future periods, or if different conditions exist in future \\nperiods, impairment charges could result. The total future impairment charges we may be required to record could be material.\\nEquity Method Investments\\nEquity method investments are reviewed for impairment whenever significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that \\nthe carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. When such events or changes occur, we evaluate the fair value \\ncompared to our cost basis in the investment. The fair values of most of our Company’s investments in publicly traded \\ncompanies are readily available based on quoted market prices. For investments in nonpublicly traded companies, \\nmanagement’s assessment of fair value is based on various valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flows, estimates \\nof sales proceeds, and appraisals, as appropriate. We consider the assumptions that we believe a market participant would use in \\nevaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or estimates of sales proceeds valuation \\nmethodologies. The ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in emerging and developing markets, may impact \\nthe determination of fair value. In the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis, management is \\nrequired to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. If management determines the decline is other than \\ntemporary, an impairment charge is recorded. Management’s assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is based on, \\namong other things, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis; the financial \\ncondition and near-term prospects of the issuer; and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient \\nto allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a \\ndiscussion of impairment charges, if applicable. \\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets \\nImpairment tests for indefinite-lived intangible assets must be performed at least annually, or more frequently if events or \\ncircumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. Our Company performs the annual impairment tests as of the first day of \\nour third fiscal quarter. We perform impairment tests using various valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flow \\nmodels and a market approach, to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset or the reporting unit, as \\napplicable. The ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in emerging and developing markets, may impact the \\ndetermination of fair value. When performing these impairment tests, we estimate the fair values of the assets using \\nmanagement’s best assumptions, which we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use. The estimates and \\nassumptions used in these tests are evaluated and updated as appropriate.\\nFor indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge \\nis recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of indefinite-\\nlived intangible assets, other than goodwill, rather than completing the impairment test. The Company must assess whether it is \\nmore likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes that \\nthis is the case, it must perform the impairment testing described above. \\nWe perform impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level, which is generally one level below our operating \\nsegments. Our operating segments are primarily based on geographic responsibility, which is consistent with the way \\nmanagement runs our business. Our geographic operating segments are generally subdivided into smaller geographic regions. \\nThese geographic regions are our reporting units. Our Global Ventures operating segment includes the results of our Costa, \\ninnocent and doğadan businesses, as well as fees earned pursuant to distribution coordination agreements between the Company \\nand Monster, each of which is its own reporting unit. The Bottling Investments operating segment includes all of our \\nconsolidated bottling operations, regardless of geographic location. Generally, each consolidated bottling operation within our \\nBottling Investments operating segment is its own reporting unit. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or units that benefit \\nfrom the synergies arising from each business combination.\\nIn order to test for goodwill impairment, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, \\nincluding goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is written down for the \\namount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. However, the impairment charge recognized \\ncannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The assumptions used in our impairment testing models are consistent with \\nthose we believe a market participant would use. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill \\nrather than completing the impairment test. The Company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of \\nthe reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the \\nimpairment testing discussed above. Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any further assessment.\\n39\\nIntangible assets acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment, because they are recorded at fair \\nvalue based on recent operating plans and macroeconomic conditions present at the time of acquisition. Consequently, if \\noperating results and/or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate shortly after an acquisition, it could result in the impairment of \\nthe acquired assets. A deterioration of macroeconomic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash \\nflows used in our cash flow models but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses, including, but not \\nlimited to, the discount rates. If the discount rates change, our Company may recognize an impairment of an intangible asset in \\nspite of realizing actual cash flows that are equal to, or greater than, our previously forecasted amounts. Refer to Note 2 of \\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent acquisitions, if applicable.\\nIn November 2021, the Company acquired the remaining 85% ownership interest in, and now owns 100% of BodyArmor, \\nwhich offers a line of sports performance and hydration beverages. The Company allocated $4.2 billion of the purchase price to \\nthe BodyArmor trademark. As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of this trademark approximates its carrying value. If the \\nnear-term operating results of this trademark do not achieve our current financial projections, or if the macroeconomic \\nconditions change causing the discount rate to increase without an offsetting increase in the operating results, it is likely that we \\nwould be required to recognize an impairment charge. Management will continue to monitor the fair value of this trademark in \\nfuture periods.\\nPension Plan Valuations\\nOur Company sponsors a qualified pension plan covering substantially all U.S. employees as well as unfunded nonqualified \\npension plans for certain employees in the United States. In addition, our Company and its subsidiaries have various pension \\nplans outside the United States.\\nManagement is required to make certain critical estimates related to the actuarial assumptions used to determine our pension \\nobligations and our net periodic pension cost or income. We believe the two most critical assumptions are the discount rate and \\nthe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Our actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually, or more frequently to the \\nextent that a settlement or curtailment occurs. Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement \\nof our pension obligations and our net periodic pension cost or income.\\nThe discount rate assumption used to account for pension plans reflects the rate at which the benefit obligations could be \\neffectively settled. The discount rate for U.S. and certain non-U.S. plans is determined using a matching technique whereby the \\nrates of a yield curve, developed from high-quality debt securities, are applied to projected benefit cash flows to determine the \\nappropriate effective discount rate. For other non-U.S. plans, we base the discount rate assumption on comparable indices \\nwithin each of the respective countries. The Company measures the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic \\npension cost or income by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plans’ projected cash flows. \\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based upon the long-term outlook of our investment strategy as well as \\nour historical returns and volatilities for each asset class. We also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess \\nthe reasonableness of our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Our investment objective for our pension assets is to \\nensure all funded pension plans have sufficient assets to meet their benefit obligations when they become due. As a result, the \\nCompany periodically revises asset allocations, where appropriate, to seek to improve returns and manage risk. \\nIn 2023, the Company’s total cost related to pension plans was $120 million, which included $38 million of net periodic \\npension cost and net charges of $82 million, primarily due to settlements and special termination benefits. In 2024, we expect \\nour net periodic pension cost to be approximately $51 million. The increase in net periodic pension cost is primarily due to the \\nnet impact of the decrease in the weighted-average discount rate at December 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022. \\nAs of December 31, 2023, the U.S. qualified pension plan represented 63% and 56% of the Company’s consolidated projected \\nbenefit obligation and pension plan assets, respectively. For this plan, we estimate that a 50 basis-point decrease in the discount \\nrate would result in an $8 million increase in our 2024 net periodic pension cost, and we estimate that a 50 basis-point decrease \\nin the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would result in a $19 million increase in our 2024 net periodic pension \\ncost.\\nRefer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our pension plans and related \\nactuarial assumptions. \\nRevenue Recognition\\nRevenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contracts with our customers are satisfied. Our \\nperformance obligation generally consists of the promise to sell concentrates, syrups or finished products to our bottling \\npartners, wholesalers, distributors or retailers. Control of the concentrates, syrups or finished products is transferred upon \\nshipment to, or receipt at, our customers’ locations, as determined by the specific terms of the contract. Upon transfer of control \\nto the customer, which completes our performance obligation, revenue is recognized. Our sales terms generally do not allow for \\n40\\na right of return except for matters related to any manufacturing defects on our part. After completion of our performance \\nobligation, we have an unconditional right to consideration as outlined in the contract. Our receivables will generally be \\ncollected in less than six months, in accordance with the underlying payment terms. All of our performance obligations under \\nthe terms of contracts with our customers have an original duration of one year or less.\\nIn most markets, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned \\nfinancial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers’ always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented \\nan incidence-based concentrate pricing model. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of \\nfactors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates \\nare sold, and package mix. The amounts associated with the arrangements described above represent variable consideration, an \\nestimate of which is included in the transaction price as a component of net operating revenues in our consolidated statement of \\nincome upon completion of our performance obligations. The total revenue recorded, including any variable consideration, \\ncannot exceed the amount for which it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur when uncertainties related to \\nvariability are resolved. As a result, we are recognizing revenue based on our faithful depiction of the consideration that we \\nexpect to receive. In making our estimates of variable consideration, we consider past results and make significant assumptions \\nrelated to: (1) customer sales volumes; (2) customer ending inventories; (3) customer selling price per unit; (4) selling channels; \\nand (5) discount rates, rebates and other pricing allowances, as applicable. In gathering data to estimate our variable \\nconsideration, we generally calculate our estimates using a portfolio approach at the country and product line level rather than \\nat the individual contract level. The result of making these estimates will impact the line items trade accounts receivable or \\naccounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet, as applicable. The actual amounts ultimately paid \\nand/or received may be different from our estimates.\\nIncome Taxes \\nOur annual effective tax rate is based on our income and the tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. \\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our annual income tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions. We \\nestablish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the position \\nbecomes uncertain based upon one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is not “more likely than not” to be sustained; \\n(2) the tax position is “more likely than not” to be sustained, but for a lesser amount; or (3) the tax position is “more likely than \\nnot” to be sustained, but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken. For purposes of evaluating \\nwhether or not a tax position is uncertain, (1) we presume the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that \\nhas full knowledge of all relevant information; (2) the technical merits of a tax position are derived from authorities such as \\nlegislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings and caselaw and their applicability to the facts and circumstances \\nof the tax position; and (3) each tax position is evaluated without consideration of the possibility of offset or aggregation with \\nother tax positions taken. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of \\nchanging facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. Refer to the heading “Operations Review — Income \\nTaxes” below and Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\\nA number of years may elapse before a particular uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved. The number of years \\nsubject to tax audits or tax assessments varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously \\nreserved because of a failure to meet the “more likely than not” recognition threshold would be recognized in income tax \\nexpense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax \\nposition is “more likely than not” to be sustained; (2) the tax position, amount and/or timing is ultimately settled through \\nnegotiation or litigation; or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue \\nwould usually require the use of cash. Refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\\nTax laws require certain items to be included in the tax return at different times than when these items are reflected in the \\nconsolidated financial statements. As a result, the annual effective tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is \\ndifferent from that reported in our tax return (our cash tax rate). Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that \\nare not deductible in our tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. Deferred tax assets \\nand liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The \\ntax rates used to determine deferred tax assets or liabilities are the enacted tax rates in effect for the year and for the manner in \\nwhich the differences are expected to reverse. Based on the evaluation of all available information, the Company recognizes \\nfuture tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered more likely \\nthan not.\\nWe evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing our forecasted taxable income \\nusing both historical and projected future operating results; the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences; taxable \\nincome in prior carryback years (if permitted); and the availability of tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is required \\n41\\nto be established unless management determines that it is more likely than not that the Company will ultimately realize the tax \\nbenefit associated with a deferred tax asset.\\nThe Company does not record a U.S. deferred tax liability for the excess of the book basis over the tax basis of its investments \\nin foreign subsidiaries to the extent that the basis difference meets the indefinite reversal criteria. These criteria are met if the \\nforeign subsidiary has invested, or will invest, the undistributed earnings indefinitely. The decision as to the amount of \\nundistributed earnings that the Company intends to maintain in non-U.S. subsidiaries takes into account various items, \\nincluding, but not limited to, forecasts and budgets of financial needs of cash for working capital, liquidity plans, capital \\nimprovement programs, merger and acquisition plans, and planned loans to other non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company also \\nevaluates its expected cash requirements in the United States. Other factors that can influence that determination are local \\nrestrictions on remittances (for example, in some countries a central bank application and approval are required in order for the \\nCompany’s local country subsidiary to pay a dividend), economic stability and asset risk. Refer to Note 15 of Notes to \\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\\nOPERATIONS REVIEW\\nOur organizational structure consists of the following operating segments: Europe, Middle East and Africa; Latin America; \\nNorth America; Asia Pacific; Global Ventures; and Bottling Investments. Our operating structure also includes Corporate, \\nwhich consists of a center and a platform services organization. For additional information regarding our operating segments \\nand Corporate, refer to Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\\nStructural Changes, Acquired Brands and Newly Licensed Brands\\nIn order to continually improve upon the Company’s operating performance, from time to time, we engage in buying and \\nselling ownership interests in bottling partners and other manufacturing operations. In addition, we periodically acquire brands \\nand their related operations or enter into license agreements for certain brands to supplement our beverage offerings. These \\nitems impact our operating results and certain key metrics used by management in assessing the Company’s performance.\\nUnit case volume growth is a key metric used by management to evaluate the Company’s performance because it measures \\ndemand for our products at the consumer level. The Company’s unit case volume represents the number of unit cases (or unit \\ncase equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to \\ncustomers or consumers and, therefore, reflects unit case volume for both consolidated and unconsolidated bottlers. Refer to the \\nheading “Beverage Volume” below.\\nConcentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances \\nexpressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished products sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other \\ncustomers. For Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, concentrate sales volume represents the amount of beverages, \\nprimarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents), sold by the Company to \\ncustomers or consumers. Refer to the heading “Beverage Volume” below.\\nWhen we analyze our net operating revenues, we generally consider the following factors: (1) volume growth (concentrate sales \\nvolume or unit case volume, as applicable); (2) changes in price, product and geographic mix; (3) foreign currency exchange \\nrate fluctuations; and (4) acquisitions and divestitures (including structural changes as defined below), as applicable. Refer to \\nthe heading “Net Operating Revenues” below. The Company sells concentrates and syrups to both consolidated and \\nunconsolidated bottling partners. The ownership structure of our bottling partners impacts the timing of recognizing concentrate \\nrevenue and concentrate sales volume. When we sell concentrates or syrups to our consolidated bottling partners, we do not \\nrecognize the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume until the bottling partner has sold finished products \\nmanufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party. When we sell concentrates or syrups to our unconsolidated \\nbottling partners, we recognize the concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume when the concentrates or syrups are sold \\nto the bottling partner. The subsequent sale of the finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third \\nparty does not impact the timing of recognizing the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume. When we account for an \\nunconsolidated bottling partner as an equity method investment, we eliminate the intercompany profit related to concentrate \\nsales to the extent of our ownership interest, until the equity method investee has sold finished products manufactured from the \\nconcentrates or syrups to a third party. We typically report unit case volume when finished products manufactured from the \\nconcentrates or syrups are sold to a third party, regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any.\\nWe generally refer to acquisitions and divestitures of bottling operations as “structural changes,” which are a component of \\nacquisitions and divestitures. Typically, structural changes do not impact the Company’s unit case volume or concentrate sales \\nvolume on a consolidated basis or at the geographic operating segment level. We recognize unit case volume for all sales of \\nCompany beverage products, regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any. However, the unit case volume \\nreported by our Bottling Investments operating segment is generally impacted by structural changes because it only includes the \\n42\\nunit case volume of our consolidated bottling operations. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for \\nadditional information on the Company’s acquisitions and divestitures. \\n“Acquired brands” refers to brands acquired during the past 12 months. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case \\nvolume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to acquired brands in periods prior to the closing of a transaction. \\nTherefore, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume related to an acquired brand are incremental to prior year volume. \\nWe generally do not consider the acquisition of a brand to be a structural change.\\n“Licensed brands” refers to brands not owned by the Company but for which we hold certain rights, generally including, but not \\nlimited to, distribution rights, and from which we derive an economic benefit when the related products are sold. Typically, the \\nCompany has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to a licensed brand in periods prior \\nto the beginning of the term of a license agreement. Therefore, in the year that a license agreement is entered into, the unit case \\nvolume and concentrate sales volume related to a licensed brand are incremental to prior year volume. We generally do not \\nconsider the licensing of a brand to be a structural change.\\nIn August 2022, the Company acquired a controlling interest in a bottling operation in Malawi. The impact of this acquisition \\nhas been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the \\nBottling Investments and Europe, Middle East and Africa operating segments. Additionally, the Company refranchised our \\nbottling operations in Cambodia and Vietnam in November 2022 and January 2023, respectively, the impact of which has been \\nincluded as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Bottling \\nInvestments and Asia Pacific operating segments.\\nIn May 2023 and July 2022, the Company acquired certain brands in Asia Pacific. The impact of acquiring these brands has \\nbeen included in acquisitions and divestitures in our analysis of net revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Asia \\nPacific operating segment.\\nBeverage Volume\\nWe measure the volume of Company beverage products sold in two ways: (1) unit cases of finished products and \\n(2) concentrate sales. As used in this report, “unit case” means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished \\nbeverage (24 eight-ounce servings), with the exception of unit case equivalents for Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, \\nwhich are primarily measured in number of transactions; and “unit case volume” means the number of unit cases (or unit case \\nequivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers or \\nconsumers. Unit case volume consists primarily of beverage products bearing Company trademarks. Also included in unit case \\nvolume are certain brands licensed to, or distributed by, our Company, and brands owned by Coca-Cola system bottlers for \\nwhich our Company provides marketing support and from the sale of which we derive an economic benefit. In addition, unit \\ncase volume includes sales by certain joint ventures in which the Company has an ownership interest. We believe unit case \\nvolume is one of the indicators of the underlying strength of the Coca-Cola system because it measures demand for our \\nproducts at the consumer level. The unit case volume numbers used in this report are derived based on estimates received by the \\nCompany from its bottling partners and distributors. Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, \\nsource waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished beverages \\nsold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. For Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, concentrate \\nsales volume represents the amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in \\nunit case equivalents), sold by the Company to customers or consumers. Unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth \\nrates are not necessarily equal during any given period. Factors such as seasonality, bottlers’ inventory practices, supply point \\nchanges, timing of price increases, new product introductions and changes in product mix can create differences between unit \\ncase volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates. In addition to these items, the impact of unit case volume from certain \\njoint ventures in which the Company has an ownership interest, but to which the Company does not sell concentrates, syrups, \\nsource waters or powders/minerals, may give rise to differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth \\nrates.\\n43\\nInformation about our volume growth worldwide and by operating segment is as follows:\\nPercent Change 2023 versus 2022\\nUnit Cases\\n1,2\\nConcentrate \\nSales\\nWorldwide\\n 2% \\n 2% \\nEurope, Middle East & Africa\\n (2) \\n — \\nLatin America\\n 5 \\n 6 \\nNorth America\\n (1) \\n (1) \\nAsia Pacific\\n 3 \\n — \\nGlobal Ventures\\n 4 \\n 5 \\nBottling Investments\\n (1) \\n3\\n         N/A\\n1 Bottling Investments operating segment data reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only.\\n2 Geographic and Global Ventures operating segment data reflect unit case volume growth for all bottlers, both consolidated and \\nunconsolidated, and distributors in the applicable geographic areas. Global Ventures operating segment data also reflects unit case volume \\ngrowth for Costa retail stores.\\n3 After considering the impact of structural changes, unit case volume for Bottling Investments grew 6%.\\nUnit Case Volume\\nThe Coca-Cola system sold 33.3 billion and 32.7 billion unit cases of our products in 2023 and 2022, respectively.\\nUnit case volume in Europe, Middle East and Africa decreased 2%, which included a 3% decline in sparkling flavors, a 14% \\ndecline in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages, a 1% decline in Trademark Coca-Cola, and a 2% decline in \\nwater, sports, coffee and tea. The operating segment reported declines in unit case volume of 6% in the Europe operating unit \\nand 1% in the Eurasia and Middle East operating unit, partially offset by growth in unit case volume of 3% in the Africa \\noperating unit. The decline in unit case volume in Europe, Middle East and Africa was primarily due to the suspension of the \\nCompany’s business in Russia in March 2022. \\nIn Latin America, unit case volume increased 5%, which included 5% growth in Trademark Coca-Cola, 9% growth in water, \\nsports, coffee and tea, 2% growth in sparkling flavors and 3% growth in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages. \\nThe operating segment’s volume performance included 5% growth in both Mexico and Brazil.\\nUnit case volume in North America decreased 1%, which included a 5% decline in water, sports, coffee and tea, partially offset \\nby 3% growth in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages and 1% growth in sparkling flavors. Trademark Coca-Cola \\nperformance was even.\\nIn Asia Pacific, unit case volume increased 3%, which included 4% growth in both sparkling flavors and Trademark Coca-Cola, \\n10% growth in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages, and 1% growth in water, sports, coffee and tea. The \\noperating segment reported growth in unit case volume of 11% in the India and Southwest Asia operating unit, 2% in the \\nGreater China and Mongolia operating unit, and 1% in both the ASEAN and South Pacific and the Japan and South Korea \\noperating units.\\nUnit case volume for Global Ventures increased 4%, driven by growth in energy drinks, partially offset by a 1% decline in both \\nwater, sports, coffee and tea as well as juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages.\\nUnit case volume for Bottling Investments decreased 1%, which primarily reflects the impact of refranchising our bottling \\noperations in Vietnam and Cambodia, partially offset by growth in India and South Africa. \\nConcentrate Sales Volume\\nIn 2023, worldwide concentrate sales volume and unit case volume both grew 2% compared to 2022. The differences between \\nconcentrate sales volume and unit case volume growth rates for the operating segments were primarily due to the timing of \\nconcentrate shipments and the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in which the Company has an ownership \\ninterest, but to which the Company does not sell concentrates, syrups, source waters or powders/minerals.\\n44\\nNet Operating Revenues\\nNet operating revenues were $45,754 million in 2023, compared to $43,004 million in 2022, an increase of $2,750 million, or \\n6%. \\nThe following table illustrates, on a percentage basis, the estimated impact of the factors resulting in the increase (decrease) in \\nnet operating revenues on a consolidated basis and for each of our operating segments:\\nPercent Change 2023 versus 2022\\nVolume1\\nPrice, Product & \\nGeographic Mix\\nForeign Currency \\nExchange Rate \\nFluctuations\\nAcquisitions & \\nDivestitures2 \\nTotal\\nConsolidated\\n 2% \\n 10% \\n (4) %\\n (1) %\\n 6% \\nEurope, Middle East & Africa\\n — \\n 19 \\n (12) \\n — \\n 7 \\nLatin America\\n 6 \\n 16 \\n (3) \\n — \\n 19 \\nNorth America\\n (1) \\n 8 \\n — \\n — \\n 7 \\nAsia Pacific\\n — \\n 5 \\n (5) \\n 1 \\n — \\nGlobal Ventures\\n 5 \\n 2 \\n — \\n — \\n 8 \\nBottling Investments\\n 6 \\n 8 \\n (7) \\n (8) \\n — \\nNote: Certain rows may not add due to rounding.\\n1 Represents the percent change in net operating revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in concentrate sales volume for our \\ngeographic operating segments and our Global Ventures operating segment (expressed in unit case equivalents) after considering the impact \\nof acquisitions and divestitures, if any. For our Bottling Investments operating segment, this represents the percent change in net operating \\nrevenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. Our Bottling \\nInvestments operating segment data reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only after considering the impact of structural \\nchanges, if any. Refer to the heading “Beverage Volume” above.\\n2 Includes structural changes, if any. Refer to the heading “Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and Newly Licensed Brands” above.\\nRefer to the heading “Beverage Volume” above for additional information related to changes in our unit case and concentrate \\nsales volumes.\\n“Price, product and geographic mix” refers to the change in net operating revenues caused by factors such as price changes, the \\nmix of products and packages sold, and the mix of channels and geographic territories where the sales occurred. The impact of \\nprice, product and geographic mix is calculated by subtracting the change in net operating revenues resulting from volume \\nincreases or decreases, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and acquisitions and divestitures from the total change \\nin net operating revenues. Management believes that providing investors with price, product and geographic mix enhances their \\nunderstanding about the combined impact that the following items had on the Company’s net operating revenues: (1) pricing \\nactions taken by the Company and, where applicable, our bottling partners; (2) changes in the mix of products and packages \\nsold; (3) changes in the mix of channels where products were sold; and (4) changes in the mix of geographic territories where \\nproducts were sold. Management uses this measure in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the \\nCompany’s performance. \\nPrice, product and geographic mix had a 10% favorable impact on our consolidated net operating revenues. Price, product and \\ngeographic mix was impacted by a variety of factors and events, including, but not limited to, the following:\\n• Europe, Middle East and Africa — favorable pricing initiatives, including inflationary pricing in Türkiye and Zimbabwe, \\npartially offset by unfavorable geographic mix;\\n• Latin America — favorable pricing initiatives, including inflationary pricing in Argentina, along with favorable channel \\nand product mix, partially offset by increased funding for promotional and marketing support;\\n• North America — favorable pricing initiatives and favorable channel, package and product mix;\\n• Asia Pacific — favorable pricing initiatives, partially offset by unfavorable geographic mix and increased funding for \\npromotional and marketing support;\\n• Global Ventures — favorable pricing initiatives and favorable channel mix, primarily due to the favorable performance \\nof Costa in the United Kingdom, offset by unfavorable product mix and the impact of no longer receiving COVID-\\nrelated incentives in the current year; and\\n• Bottling Investments — favorable pricing initiatives across most markets, partially offset by unfavorable geographic \\nmix.\\n45\\nThe favorable pricing initiatives for the year ended December 31, 2023 in all operating segments included carryover pricing \\nincreases from the prior year.\\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our consolidated net operating revenues by 4%. This unfavorable \\nimpact was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies, including the Argentine peso, \\nZimbabwean dollar, South African rand, Nigerian naira, Turkish lira, Japanese yen, Indian rupee and Chinese yuan, which had \\nan unfavorable impact on our Latin America; Europe, Middle East and Africa; Asia Pacific; and Bottling Investments operating \\nsegments. The unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to the currencies listed above was partially offset by the \\nimpact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the Mexican peso, which had a favorable \\nimpact on our Latin America operating segment. Refer to the heading “Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position — \\nForeign Exchange” below for additional information about the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\\n“Acquisitions and divestitures” generally refers to acquisitions and divestitures of brands or businesses, some of which the \\nCompany considers to be structural changes. The impact of acquisitions and divestitures is the difference between the change in \\nnet operating revenues and the change in what our net operating revenues would have been if we removed the net operating \\nrevenues associated with an acquisition or a divestiture from either the current year or the prior year, as applicable. \\nManagement believes that quantifying the impact that acquisitions and divestitures had on the Company’s net operating \\nrevenues provides investors with useful information to enhance their understanding of the Company’s net operating revenue \\nperformance by improving their ability to compare our year-to-year results. Management considers the impact of acquisitions \\nand divestitures when evaluating the Company’s performance. Refer to the heading “Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and \\nNewly Licensed Brands” above for additional information related to acquisitions and divestitures.\\nNet operating revenue growth rates are impacted by sales volume; price, product and geographic mix; foreign currency \\nexchange rate fluctuations; and acquisitions and divestitures. The size and timing of acquisitions and divestitures are not \\nconsistent from period to period. Based on current spot rates and our hedging coverage in place, we expect foreign currency \\nexchange rate fluctuations will have an unfavorable impact on our full year 2024 net operating revenues.\\nInformation about our net operating revenues by operating segment and Corporate as a percentage of Company net operating \\nrevenues is as follows:\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\nEurope, Middle East & Africa\\n 16.2% \\n 16.0% \\nLatin America\\n 12.7 \\n 11.4 \\nNorth America\\n 36.6 \\n 36.5 \\nAsia Pacific\\n 10.3 \\n 11.0 \\nGlobal Ventures\\n 6.7 \\n 6.6 \\nBottling Investments\\n 17.2 \\n 18.3 \\nCorporate\\n 0.3 \\n 0.2 \\nTotal\\n 100.0% \\n 100.0% \\nThe percentage contribution of each operating segment fluctuates over time due to net operating revenues in some operating \\nsegments growing at a faster rate compared to other operating segments. In addition, foreign currency exchange rate \\nfluctuations impact the percentage contribution of each operating segment. For additional information about the impact of \\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations, refer to the heading “Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position — \\nForeign Exchange” below. \\nGross Profit Margin\\nGross profit margin is a ratio calculated by dividing gross profit by net operating revenues. Management believes gross profit \\nmargin provides investors with useful information related to the profitability of our business prior to considering all of the \\nselling, general and administrative expenses and other operating charges incurred. Management uses this measure in making \\nfinancial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company’s performance. \\nOur gross profit margin increased to 59.5% in 2023 from 58.1% in 2022. This increase was primarily due to the impact of \\nfavorable pricing initiatives, favorable channel and package mix, and structural changes. The impact of these items was \\npartially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and increased commodity costs. \\n46\\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\\nThe following table sets forth the components of selling, general and administrative expenses (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\nSelling and distribution expenses\\n$ \\n2,599 $ \\n2,767 \\nAdvertising expenses\\n \\n5,010  \\n4,319 \\nStock-based compensation expense\\n \\n254  \\n356 \\nOther operating expenses\\n \\n6,109  \\n5,438 \\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\\n$ \\n13,972 $ \\n12,880 \\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $1,092 million, or 8%, in 2023. This increase was primarily due to \\nhigher advertising and other operating expenses, partially offset by decreases in selling and distribution expenses and stock-\\nbased compensation expense. The increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to higher other marketing expenses \\nand increased charitable donations, as well as higher annual incentive expense and other employee benefit costs. The decrease \\nin selling and distribution expenses was primarily a result of the refranchising of our bottling operations in Vietnam and \\nCambodia. The decrease in stock-based compensation expense was primarily due to the cumulative expense that was recorded \\nin 2022 resulting from the impact a more favorable financial outlook had on the outstanding nonvested performance share units. \\nIn 2023, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased selling, general and administrative expenses by 3%.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $267 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock-based \\ncompensation awards granted under our plans, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years as \\nstock-based compensation expense. This expected cost does not include the impact of any future stock-based compensation \\nawards.

In addition, other operating charges included $27 million related to the \\nrestructuring of our North America operating unit, $15 million for the amortization of noncompete agreements related to the \\nBodyArmor acquisition in 2021 and $8 million related to tax litigation expense.\\nIn 2022, the Company recorded other operating charges of $1,215 million. These charges primarily consisted of $1,000 million \\nrelated to the remeasurement of our contingent consideration liability to fair value in conjunction with the fairlife acquisition, \\n$85 million related to the Company’s productivity and reinvestment program and $57 million related to the impairment of a \\ntrademark in Asia Pacific. In addition, other operating charges included $38 million related to the restructuring of our North \\nAmerica operating unit and $38 million related to the BodyArmor acquisition, which included various transition and transaction \\ncosts, employee retention costs and the amortization of noncompete agreements, net of the reimbursement of distributor \\ntermination fees recorded in 2021. These charges were partially offset by a net gain of $6 million due to revisions of \\nmanagement’s estimates related to the Company’s strategic realignment initiatives. \\nRefer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the BodyArmor acquisition.

In 2023, equity income was $1,691 million, compared to equity income of $1,472 million in 2022, an \\nincrease of $219 million, or 15%. The increase reflects, among other items, the impact of more favorable operating results \\nreported by some of our equity method investees in the current year and a favorable foreign currency exchange rate impact. \\nThese favorable impacts were partially offset by a $125 million increase in net charges resulting from the Company’s \\nproportionate share of significant operating and nonoperating items recorded by certain of our equity method investees.\\nOther Income (Loss) — Net\\nIn 2023, other income (loss) — net was income of $570 million.

As a result of employment actions and capital investments made by \\nthe Company, certain tax jurisdictions provide income tax incentive grants, including Brazil, Costa Rica, Singapore and \\nEswatini. The terms of these grants expire from 2025 to 2036. We anticipate that we will be able to extend or renew the grants \\nin these locations. Tax incentive grants favorably impacted our income tax expense by $332 million and $406 million for the \\nyears ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In addition, our effective tax rate reflects the benefits of having \\nsignificant earnings generated in investments accounted for under the equity method. \\nA reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal tax rate and our effective tax rate is as follows:\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\nStatutory U.S. federal tax rate\\n 21.0% \\n 21.0% \\nState and local income taxes — net of federal benefit\\n 1.1 \\n 1.4 \\nEarnings in jurisdictions taxed at rates different from the statutory U.S. federal tax rate\\n (0.3) \\n (0.6) \\nEquity income or loss\\n (2.1) \\n (2.7) \\nExcess tax benefits on stock-based compensation\\n (0.3) \\n (0.7) \\nOther — net\\n (2.0) \\n (0.3) \\nEffective tax rate\\n 17.4% \\n 18.1% \\nOn November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued the Opinion regarding the Company’s 2015 litigation with the IRS involving \\ntransfer pricing tax adjustments in which the court predominantly sided with the IRS. On November 8, 2023, the Tax Court \\nissued a supplemental opinion, siding with the IRS in concluding both that the blocked-income regulations apply to the \\nCompany’s operations and that the Tax Court opinion in 3M Co. & Subs. v. Commissioner (February 9, 2023) controlled as to \\nthe validity of those regulations. The Company strongly disagrees with the Opinions and intends to vigorously defend its \\nposition. Refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $929 million. If the Company were to prevail on \\nall uncertain tax positions, the net effect would be a benefit of $632 million, exclusive of any benefits related to interest and \\npenalties. The remaining $297 million primarily represents tax benefits that would be received in different tax jurisdictions in \\nthe event the Company did not prevail on all uncertain tax positions.\\n50\\nA reconciliation of the changes in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\nBalance of unrecognized tax benefits at beginning of year\\n$ \\n926 $ \\n906 \\nIncrease related to prior period tax positions\\n \\n2  \\n6 \\nDecrease related to prior period tax positions\\n \\n(25)  \\n— \\nIncrease related to current period tax positions\\n \\n32  \\n38 \\nDecrease related to settlements with taxing authorities\\n \\n—  \\n(2) \\nDecrease due to lapse of the applicable statute of limitations\\n \\n(2)  \\n— \\nEffect of foreign currency translation\\n \\n(4)  \\n(22) \\nBalance of unrecognized tax benefits at end of year\\n$ \\n929 $ \\n926 \\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the line item income taxes in our \\nconsolidated statement of income. The Company had $544 million and $496 million in interest and penalties related to \\nunrecognized tax benefits accrued as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Of these amounts, expense of $48 million \\nand $43 million was recognized in 2023 and 2022, respectively. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, \\nthe reversal of this accrual would be a benefit to the Company’s effective tax rate.\\nBased on current tax laws, the Company’s effective tax rate in 2024 is expected to be approximately 19.2% before considering \\nthe potential impact of any significant operating and nonoperating items that may affect our effective tax rate. This rate does not \\ninclude the impact of the ongoing tax litigation with the IRS, if the Company were not to prevail.\\nMany jurisdictions have enacted legislation and adopted policies resulting from the OECD’s Anti-Base Erosion and Profit \\nShifting project. The OECD is currently coordinating a two pillared project on behalf of the G20 and other participating \\ncountries which would grant additional taxing rights over profits earned by multinational enterprises to the countries in which \\ntheir products are sold and services rendered. Pillar One would allow countries to reallocate a portion of profits earned by \\nmultinational businesses with an annual global revenue exceeding €20 billion and a profit margin of over 10% to applicable \\nmarket jurisdictions. While the OECD issued draft language for the international implementation of Pillar One in October 2023, \\nboth the substantive rules and implementation process remain under discussion at the OECD so the timetable for any \\nimplementation remains uncertain. \\nIn December 2021, the OECD issued Pillar Two model rules which would establish a global per-country minimum tax of 15%, \\nand the European Union has approved a directive requiring member states to incorporate similar provisions into their respective \\ndomestic laws. The directive requires the rules to initially become effective for fiscal years starting on or after December 31, \\n2023. While it is uncertain whether the United States will enact legislation to adopt Pillar Two, numerous countries have \\nenacted legislation, or have indicated their intent to adopt legislation, to implement certain aspects of Pillar Two effective \\nJanuary 1, 2024, with general implementation of the remaining global minimum tax rules by January 1, 2025. The OECD and \\nimplementing countries are expected to continue to make further revisions to their legislation and release additional guidance. \\nThe Company will continue to monitor developments to determine any potential impact in the countries in which we operate.\\nLIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND FINANCIAL POSITION\\nWe believe our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities is one of the fundamental strengths of our business. \\nRefer to the heading “Cash Flows from Operating Activities” below. The Company does not typically raise capital through the \\nissuance of stock. Instead, we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital and increase our return on shareowners’ \\nequity. Refer to the heading “Cash Flows from Financing Activities” below. We have a history of borrowing funds both \\ndomestically and internationally at reasonable interest rates, and we expect to be able to continue to borrow funds at reasonable \\nrates over the long term. Our debt financing also includes the use of a commercial paper program. We currently have the ability \\nto borrow funds in this market at levels that are consistent with our debt financing strategy, and we expect to continue to be able \\nto do so in the future. The Company regularly reviews its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt. \\nThe Company’s cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities totaled $13.7 billion as of \\nDecember 31, 2023. In addition to these funds, our commercial paper program and our ability to issue long-term debt, we had \\n$4.6 billion in unused backup lines of credit for general corporate purposes as of December 31, 2023. These backup lines of \\ncredit expire at various times through 2028.\\n51\\nOur current payment terms with the majority of our suppliers are 120 days. Two global financial institutions offer a voluntary \\nsupply chain finance program which enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from the Company to \\nthese financial institutions on a non-recourse basis at a rate that leverages our credit rating and thus may be more beneficial to \\nthem. We do not believe there is a risk that our payment terms will be shortened in the near future. Refer to Note 9 of Notes to \\nConsolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\\nThe Company has a trade accounts receivable factoring program in certain countries. Under this program, we can elect to sell \\ntrade accounts receivables to unaffiliated financial institutions at a discount. In these factoring arrangements, for ease of \\nadministration, the Company collects customer payments related to the factored receivables and remits those payments to the \\nfinancial institutions. The Company sold $17,704 million and $10,709 million of trade accounts receivables under this program \\nduring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The costs of factoring such receivables were $83 million and \\n$27 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The cash received from the financial institutions is \\nclassified within the operating activities section in our consolidated statement of cash flows.\\nOur current capital allocation priorities are as follows: investing wisely to support our business operations, continuing to grow \\nour dividend payment, enhancing our beverage portfolio and capabilities through consumer-centric acquisitions, and using \\nexcess cash to repurchase shares over time. We currently expect 2024 capital expenditures to be approximately $2.2 billion. \\nDuring 2024, we also expect to repurchase shares to offset dilution resulting from employee stock-based compensation plans.\\nWe are currently in litigation with the IRS for tax years 2007 through 2009. On November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued the \\nOpinion in which it predominantly sided with the IRS. On November 8, 2023, the Tax Court issued a supplemental opinion, \\nsiding with the IRS in concluding both that the blocked-income regulations apply to the Company’s operations and that the Tax \\nCourt opinion in 3M Co. & Subs. v. Commissioner (February 9, 2023) controlled as to the validity of those regulations. The \\nCompany strongly disagrees with the IRS’ positions and the portions of the Opinions affirming such positions and intends to \\nvigorously defend our positions utilizing every available avenue of appeal. While the Company believes that it is more likely \\nthan not that we will ultimately prevail in this litigation upon appeal, it is possible that all, or some portion of, the adjustments \\nproposed by the IRS and sustained by the Tax Court could ultimately be upheld. In the event that all of the adjustments \\nproposed by the IRS were to be ultimately upheld for tax years 2007 through 2009 and the IRS, with the consent of the federal \\ncourts, were to decide to apply the Tax Court Methodology to the subsequent years up to and including 2023, the Company \\ncurrently estimates that the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability could be approximately $16 billion as of \\nDecember 31, 2023. Additional income tax and interest would continue to accrue until the time any such potential liability, or \\nportion thereof, were to be paid. The Company and the IRS are now in the process of agreeing on the tax impacts of the \\nOpinions. Subsequent to the completion of this process, the Tax Court will render a decision in the case. The Company will \\nhave 90 days thereafter to file a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. The IRS can then seek to \\ncollect, and the Company expects to pay, any additional tax related to the 2007 through 2009 tax years reflected in the Tax \\nCourt decision (and interest thereon). The Company currently estimates that the payment to be made at that time related to the \\n2007 through 2009 tax years, which is included in the above estimate of the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest \\nliability, would be approximately $5.8 billion (including interest accrued through December 31, 2023), plus any additional \\ninterest accrued through the time of payment. Some or all of this amount, plus accrued interest, would be refunded if the \\nCompany were to prevail on appeal. Refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information \\non the tax litigation.\\nWhile we believe it is more likely than not that we will prevail in the tax litigation discussed above, we are confident that, \\nbetween our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities and our ability to borrow funds at reasonable interest rates, \\nwe can manage the range of possible outcomes in the final resolution of the matter.\\nBased on all of the aforementioned factors, the Company believes its current liquidity position is strong and will continue to be \\nsufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities for the foreseeable future.\\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $11,599 million and \\n$11,018 million, respectively, an increase of $581 million, or 5%. This increase was primarily driven by strong operating \\nresults and lower marketing payments resulting from year-end accruals. These items were partially offset by an unfavorable \\nimpact due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, higher interest and tax payments in the current year, the unfavorable \\nimpact from the extension of certain vendor payment terms in the prior year, payments resulting from the buildup of inventory \\nin the prior year to manage potential supply chain disruptions, payments related to our restructuring initiatives and $167 million \\nof the $275 million milestone payment for fairlife. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for \\nadditional information on the milestone payment for fairlife.\\n52\\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\\nNet cash used in investing activities was $3,349 million and $763 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively.\\nPurchases of Investments and Proceeds from Disposals of Investments\\nIn 2023, purchases of investments were $6,698 million and proceeds from disposals of investments were $4,354 million, \\nresulting in a net cash outflow of $2,344 million. In 2022, purchases of investments were $3,751 million and proceeds from \\ndisposals of investments were $4,771 million, resulting in a net cash inflow of $1,020 million. This activity primarily represents \\nthe purchases of, and proceeds from the disposals of, investments in marketable securities and short-term investments that were \\nmade as part of the Company’s overall cash management strategy. Also included in this activity are purchases of, and proceeds \\nfrom the disposals of, investments held by our captive insurance companies.\\nAcquisitions of Businesses, Equity Method Investments and Nonmarketable Securities\\nIn 2023 and 2022, the Company’s acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled \\n$62 million and $73 million, respectively.\\nProceeds from Disposals of Businesses, Equity Method Investments and Nonmarketable Securities\\nIn 2023 and 2022, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled \\n$430 million and $458 million, respectively.

We use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital, which increases our return on shareowners’ equity. This \\nexposes us to adverse changes in interest rates. Our interest expense may also be affected by our credit ratings.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, our long-term debt was rated “A+” by Standard & Poor’s and “A1” by Moody’s. Our commercial \\npaper program was rated “A-1” by Standard & Poor’s and “P-1” by Moody’s. In assessing our credit strength, both rating \\nagencies consider our capital structure (including the amount and maturity dates of our debt) and financial policies as well as \\nthe consolidated balance sheet and other financial information of the Company. In addition, certain rating agencies also \\nconsider the financial information of certain bottlers, including CCEP, Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc., Coca-Cola FEMSA and \\nCoca-Cola Hellenic. While the Company has no legal obligation for the debt of these bottlers, the rating agencies believe the \\nstrategic importance of the bottlers to the Company’s business model provides the Company with an incentive to keep these \\nbottlers viable. It is our expectation that these rating agencies will continue using this methodology. If our credit ratings were to \\nbe downgraded as a result of changes in our capital structure, our major bottlers’ financial performance, changes in the credit \\nrating agencies’ methodology in assessing our credit strength, or for any other reason, our cost of borrowing could increase. \\nAdditionally, if certain bottlers’ credit ratings were to decline, the Company’s equity income could be reduced as a result of the \\npotential increase in interest expense for those bottlers.\\nWe monitor our financial ratios and, as indicated above, the rating agencies consider these ratios in assessing our credit ratings. \\nEach rating agency employs a different aggregation methodology and has different thresholds for the various financial ratios. \\nThese thresholds are not necessarily permanent, nor are they always fully disclosed to our Company.\\nOur global presence and strong capital position give us access to key financial markets around the world, enabling us to borrow \\nfunds at a low effective cost. This posture, coupled with active management of our mix of short-term and long-term debt as well \\nas our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, results in a lower overall cost of borrowing. Our debt management policies, in \\nconjunction with our share repurchase program and investment activity, can result in current liabilities exceeding current assets.\\nDuring 2023, the Company had issuances of debt of $6,891 million, which included $6,436 million of issuances of commercial \\npaper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days, $222 million of net issuances of commercial paper and short-\\nterm debt with maturities of 90 days or less, and long-term debt issuances of $233 million, net of related discounts and issuance \\ncosts.\\nDuring 2023, the Company made payments of debt of $5,034 million, which consisted of $4,591 million of payments related to \\ncommercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days and payments of long-term debt of $443 million.\\nDuring 2022, the Company had issuances of debt of $3,972 million, which included $2,321 million of issuances of commercial \\npaper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days, $798 million of net issuances of commercial paper and short-\\nterm debt with maturities of 90 days or less, and long-term debt issuances of $853 million, net of related discounts and issuance \\ncosts.\\nDuring 2022, the Company made payments of debt of $4,930 million, which consisted of $3,623 million of payments related to \\ncommercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days and payments of long-term debt of $1,307 million. \\nOn December 31, 2021, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, the governing body responsible for regulating \\nLIBOR, ceased to publish certain LIBOR reference rates. However, other LIBOR reference rates, including U.S. dollar \\novernight, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month maturities, continued to be published through June 2023. As a result of \\nthe discontinuation of LIBOR, we have amended our LIBOR-referencing agreements to either reference the Secured Overnight \\nFinancing Rate or include mechanics for selecting an alternative rate. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial \\nStatements for additional information on our hedging activities.\\nIssuances of Stock\\nThe issuances of stock in 2023 and 2022 were related to the exercise of stock options by employees.\\nPurchases of Stock for Treasury \\nIn 2012, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase plan of up to 500 million shares (“2012 Plan”) of the Company’s \\ncommon stock. In May 2022, the Company reached the maximum number of shares that could be repurchased under the 2012 \\nPlan and thereby completed the plan. In 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase plan of up to \\n150 million shares (“2019 Plan”) of the Company’s common stock. \\n54\\nDuring 2023, the total cash outflow for treasury stock purchases was $2,289 million. The Company repurchased 36.9 million \\nshares of common stock under the 2019 Plan authorized by our Board of Directors. These shares were repurchased at an \\naverage price per share of $59.08, for a total cost of $2,177 million. The net impact of the Company’s issuances of stock and \\ntreasury stock purchases during 2023 resulted in a net cash outflow of $1,750 million. \\nDuring 2022, the total cash outflow for treasury stock purchases was $1,418 million. The Company repurchased 21.3 million \\nshares of common stock under the share repurchase plans authorized by our Board of Directors. These shares were repurchased \\nat an average price per share of $62.67, for a total cost of $1,336 million. The net impact of the Company’s issuances of stock \\nand treasury stock purchases during 2022 resulted in a net cash outflow of $581 million. \\nSince the inception of our share repurchase program in 1984, we have repurchased 3.6 billion shares of our common stock at an \\naverage price per share of $17.96. In addition to shares repurchased under the share repurchase plans authorized by our Board \\nof Directors, the Company’s treasury stock activity also includes shares surrendered to the Company to pay the exercise price \\nand/or to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with so-called stock swap exercises of employee stock options and/\\nor the vesting of restricted stock issued to employees.\\nDividends\\nThe Company paid dividends of $7,952 million and $7,616 million during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, \\nrespectively. \\nAt its February 2024 meeting, our Board of Directors increased our regular quarterly dividend to $0.485 per share, equivalent to \\na full year dividend of $1.94 per share in 2024. This is our 62nd consecutive annual increase. Our annualized common stock \\ndividend was $1.84 per share and $1.76 per share in 2023 and 2022, respectively. \\nOther Financing Activities\\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the total cash outflow for other financing activities was $465 million and \\n$1,095 million, respectively. The activities during 2023 included $108 million of the $275 million milestone payment for \\nfairlife. The activities during 2023 and 2022 also included payments totaling $311 million and $637 million, respectively, \\nrelated to the BodyArmor acquisition, which included amounts originally held back for indemnification obligations. \\nAdditionally, other financing activities during 2022 included repayments of collateral related to our hedging programs of \\n$403 million. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the milestone \\npayment for fairlife.\\n55\\nContractual Obligations\\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company’s contractual obligations, including payments due by period, were as follows (in \\nmillions):\\nPayments Due by Period\\nTotal\\n2024\\n2025-2026\\n2027-2028\\n2029 and\\nThereafter\\nLoans and notes payable:1\\n \\n \\n  \\nCommercial paper borrowings\\n$ \\n4,209 $ \\n4,209 $ \\n— $ \\n— $ \\n— \\nLines of credit and other short-term borrowings\\n \\n348  \\n348  \\n—  \\n—  \\n— \\nCurrent maturities of long-term debt2\\n \\n1,960  \\n1,960  \\n—  \\n—  \\n— \\nLong-term debt, net of current maturities2\\n \\n36,694  \\n—  \\n2,936  \\n7,579  \\n26,179 \\nEstimated interest payments3\\n \\n9,855  \\n878  \\n1,120  \\n909  \\n6,948 \\nAccrued income taxes4\\n \\n2,649  \\n1,569  \\n1,080  \\n—  \\n— \\nPurchase obligations5\\n \\n23,392  \\n13,701  \\n3,330  \\n2,057  \\n4,304 \\nMarketing obligations6\\n \\n4,076  \\n2,563  \\n756  \\n403  \\n354 \\nLease obligations\\n \\n2,007  \\n444  \\n562  \\n363  \\n638 \\nAcquisition obligations7\\n \\n3,030  \\n13  \\n3,017  \\n—  \\n— \\nHeld-for-sale and related obligations8\\n \\n903  \\n809  \\n64  \\n21  \\n9 \\nTotal contractual obligations\\n$ \\n89,123 $ \\n26,494 $ \\n12,865 $ \\n11,332 $ \\n38,432 \\n1 Refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding loans and notes payable. Upon payment \\nof outstanding commercial paper, we typically issue new commercial paper. Lines of credit and other short-term borrowings are expected to \\nfluctuate depending upon current liquidity needs, especially at international subsidiaries.\\n2 Refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding long-term debt. We will consider \\nseveral alternatives for settling this long-term debt, including the use of cash flows from operating activities, issuance of commercial paper \\nor issuance of other long-term debt. The table above shows expected cash payments to be made by the Company and excludes the noncash \\nportion of debt, including any fair value adjustments, unamortized discounts and premiums.\\n3 We calculated estimated interest payments for our long-term debt based on the applicable rates and payment dates. For our variable-rate \\ndebt, we have assumed the December 31, 2023 rate for all periods presented. We expect to fund such interest payments with cash flows from \\noperating activities and/or short-term borrowings.\\n4 Refer to Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding income taxes. Accrued income taxes \\ninclude $2,029 million related to the one-time transition tax required by the Tax Reform Act. Liabilities of $1,476 million for unrecognized \\ntax benefits plus accrued interest and penalties are not included in the total above. Currently, the settlement period for the unrecognized tax \\nbenefits cannot be determined. In addition, any payments related to unrecognized tax benefits may be partially or fully offset by reductions \\nin payments in other jurisdictions.\\n5 Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all \\nsignificant terms. These agreements include long-term contractual obligations, open purchase orders, accounts payable and certain accrued \\nliabilities. We expect to fund these purchase obligations with cash flows from operating activities. \\n6 We expect to fund these marketing obligations with cash flows from operating activities.\\n7 Primarily represents our contingent consideration liability related to our acquisition of fairlife. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements.\\n8 Represents liabilities and contractual obligations that were classified as held for sale related to the Company’s bottling operations in the \\nPhilippines and Bangladesh and certain bottling operations in India. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for \\nadditional information.\\nThe total accrued liability for pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized as of December 31, 2023 was \\n$948 million. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This amount is impacted by, among other items, \\nnet periodic benefit cost or income, plan funding levels, plan amendments, changes in plan demographics and assumptions, and \\nthe investment return on plan assets. Because the accrued liability does not represent expected liquidity needs, we did not \\ninclude this amount in the table above.\\nWe expect to make all contributions to our pension trusts with cash flows from operating activities. Our pension plans are \\ngenerally funded in accordance with local laws and tax regulations. The Company expects to contribute approximately \\n$47 million in 2024 to our pension trusts, all of which will be allocated to our international plans. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to \\nConsolidated Financial Statements. We did not include our estimated contributions to our pension trusts in the table above.\\n56\\nAs of December 31, 2023, the projected benefit obligation of the U.S. qualified pension plan was $4,094 million, and the fair \\nvalue of the plan assets was $4,056 million. The projected benefit obligation of all pension plans other than the U.S. qualified \\npension plan was $2,450 million, and the fair value of the plans’ assets was $3,204 million. The Company sponsors various \\nunfunded pension plans outside the United States as well as unfunded nonqualified pension plans covering certain U.S. \\nemployees. These U.S. nonqualified pension plans provide benefits that are not permitted to be funded through a qualified plan \\nbecause of limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The expected benefit payments for these unfunded pension \\nplans are not included in the table above. However, we anticipate benefit payments for these unfunded pension plans will be \\napproximately $64 million annually for 2024 and 2025. Thereafter, the expected annual benefit payments will gradually \\ndecline. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\\nIn general, we are self-insured for large portions of many different types of claims; however, we do use commercial insurance \\nabove our self-insured retentions to reduce the Company’s risk of catastrophic loss. Our reserves for the Company’s self-\\ninsured losses are estimated using actuarial methods and assumptions of the insurance industry, adjusted for our specific \\nexpectations based on our claims history. As of December 31, 2023, our self-insurance reserves totaled $197 million. Refer to \\nNote 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We did not include estimated payments related to our self-insurance \\nreserves in the table above.\\nDeferred income tax liabilities as of December 31, 2023 were $2,639 million. Refer to Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements. This amount is not included in the table above because we believe that presentation would not be \\nmeaningful. Deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and \\nliabilities and their respective book bases, which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the underlying assets or \\nliabilities are settled at their reported financial statement amounts. The results of these calculations do not have a direct \\nconnection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future years. As a result, scheduling deferred income tax liabilities \\nas payments due by period could be misleading, because this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we were contingently liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third parties of $633 million, of \\nwhich $87 million was related to VIEs. Our guarantees are primarily related to third-party customers, bottlers and vendors and \\narose through the normal course of business. These guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees is individually \\nsignificant. These amounts represent the maximum potential future payments that we could be required to make under the \\nguarantees. However, management has concluded that the likelihood of any significant amounts being paid by our Company \\nunder these guarantees is remote. As of December 31, 2023, we were not directly liable for the debt of any unconsolidated \\nentity.\\nForeign Exchange\\nOur international operations are subject to certain opportunities and risks, including currency fluctuations and governmental \\nactions. We closely monitor our operations in each country and seek to adopt appropriate strategies that are responsive to \\nchanging economic and political environments as well as to fluctuations in currencies. Due to the geographic diversity of our \\noperations, weakness in some currencies may be offset by strength in other currencies over time.\\nIn 2023 and 2022, the weighted-average exchange rates for foreign currencies in which the Company conducted operations (all \\noperating currencies), and for certain individual currencies, strengthened (weakened) against the U.S. dollar as follows:\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\nAll operating currencies\\n (2) %\\n (8) %\\nAustralian dollar\\n (5) \\n (7) \\nBrazilian real\\n 3 \\n 4 \\nBritish pound\\n 2 \\n (11) \\nChinese yuan\\n (7) \\n (3) \\nEuro\\n 3 \\n (11) \\nIndian rupee\\n (6) \\n (5) \\nJapanese yen\\n (7) \\n (17) \\nMexican peso\\n 14 \\n 1 \\nPhilippine peso\\n (3) \\n (9) \\nSouth African rand\\n (11) \\n (9) \\n57\\nThe percentages in the table above do not include the effects of our hedging activities and, therefore, do not reflect the actual \\nimpact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our operating results. Our hedging activities are designed to \\nmitigate, over time, a portion of the potentially unfavorable impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our net income.\\nThe total impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on net operating revenues, including the effect of our hedging \\nactivities, was a decrease of 4% and 7% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. The total impact of foreign currency exchange rate \\nfluctuations on income before income taxes, including the effect of our hedging activities, was a decrease of 8% and 6% in \\n2023 and 2022, respectively.\\nForeign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily the result of the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities \\nfrom certain currencies into functional currencies. The effects of the remeasurement of these assets and liabilities are partially \\noffset by the impact of our economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note 5 \\nof Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses are recorded in the line item other \\nincome (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income. Refer to the heading “Operations Review — Other Income \\n(Loss) — Net” above. The Company recorded net foreign currency exchange losses of $312 million and $236 million during \\nthe years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\\nInflation affects the way we operate in many markets around the world. In general, we believe that, over time, we will be able to \\nincrease prices to counteract the majority of the inflationary effects of increasing costs and to generate sufficient cash flows to \\nmaintain our productive capability.\\nITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\\nOur Company uses derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency \\nexchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and other market risks. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments \\nfor trading purposes. As a matter of policy, all of our derivative positions are used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying \\neconomic exposure. Because of the high correlation between the hedging instruments and the underlying exposures, \\nfluctuations in the values of the instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the values of the underlying \\nexposures. \\nWe monitor our exposure to market risks using several objective measurement systems, including a sensitivity analysis to \\nmeasure our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Refer to Note 5 \\nof Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our hedging transactions and derivative \\nfinancial instruments.\\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates\\nWe manage most of our foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows us to net certain exposures and take \\nadvantage of any natural offsets. In 2023, we generated $29.2 billion of our net operating revenues from operations outside the \\nUnited States. Due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weakness in some currencies may be offset by strength in \\nother currencies over time. We use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency \\nexchange rate fluctuations.\\nOur Company enters into forward exchange contracts and purchases foreign currency options and collars (principally euro, \\nBritish pound and Japanese yen) to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. \\nAdditionally, we enter into forward exchange contracts to offset the earnings impact related to foreign currency exchange rate \\nfluctuations on certain monetary assets and liabilities. We also enter into forward exchange contracts as hedges of net \\ninvestments in foreign operations.\\nThe total notional values of our foreign currency derivatives were $17,505 million and $11,370 million as of December 31, \\n2023 and 2022, respectively. These values included derivative instruments that were designated and qualified for hedge \\naccounting along with derivative instruments that are economic hedges. The fair value of foreign currency derivatives that \\nqualified for hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized gain of $22 million as of December 31, 2023, and we estimate that a \\n10% weakening of the U.S. dollar would have resulted in a $278 million decrease in fair value. The fair value of the foreign \\ncurrency derivatives that did not qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized loss of $15 million as of \\nDecember 31, 2023, and we estimate that a 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar would have resulted in a $161 million decrease in \\nfair value.\\n58\\nInterest Rates\\nThe Company is subject to interest rate volatility with regard to existing and future issuances of debt. We monitor our mix of \\nfixed-rate and variable-rate debt as well as our mix of short-term debt and long-term debt. From time to time, we enter into \\ninterest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations.\\nBased on the Company’s variable-rate debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2023, we estimate that a \\n1 percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by $134 million in 2023. However, this \\nincrease in interest expense would have been partially offset by the increase in interest income due to higher interest rates.\\nThe Company is subject to interest rate risk related to its investments in highly liquid debt securities. These investments are \\nprimarily managed by external managers within the guidelines of the Company’s investment policy. Our policy requires these \\ninvestments to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the risk of principal loss. In addition, our policy \\nlimits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. We estimate that a 1 percentage point increase in interest rates would \\nhave resulted in a $29 million decrease in the fair value of our portfolio of highly liquid debt securities.\\nCommodity Prices\\nThe Company is subject to market risk with respect to commodity price fluctuations, principally related to our purchases of \\nsweeteners, metals, juices, PET and fuels. We manage our exposure to commodity risks primarily through the use of supplier \\npricing agreements, which enable us to establish the purchase prices for certain inputs that are used in our manufacturing and \\ndistribution operations. When deemed appropriate, we use derivative financial instruments to further manage our exposure to \\ncommodity risks. Certain of these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, but they are effective economic hedges that \\nhelp the Company mitigate the price risk associated with the purchases and transportation of materials used in our \\nmanufacturing processes.\\nThe total notional values of our commodity derivatives were $379 million and $371 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, \\nrespectively. These values included derivative instruments that were designated and qualified for hedge accounting along with \\nderivative instruments that are economic hedges. The fair value of commodity derivatives that qualified for hedge accounting \\nresulted in a net unrealized loss of $3 million as of December 31, 2023, and we estimate that a 10% decrease in underlying \\ncommodity prices would have resulted in a $3 million decrease in fair value. The fair value of the commodity derivatives that \\ndid not qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a net loss of $58 million as of December 31, 2023, and we estimate that a 10% \\ndecrease in underlying commodity prices would have resulted in a $54 million decrease in fair value.\\n59\\nITEM 8.

1: BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \\nWhen used in these notes, the terms “The Coca-Cola Company,” “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” mean The Coca-Cola \\nCompany and all entities included in our consolidated financial statements.\\nDescription of Business\\nThe Coca-Cola Company is a total beverage company. We own or license and market numerous beverage brands, which we \\ngroup into the following categories: Trademark Coca-Cola; sparkling flavors; water, sports, coffee and tea; juice, value-added \\ndairy and plant-based beverages; and emerging beverages. We own and market several of the world’s largest nonalcoholic \\nsparkling soft drink brands, including Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and Diet Coke/Coca-Cola Light. \\nFinished beverage products bearing our trademarks, sold in the United States since 1886, are now sold in more than 200 \\ncountries and territories.\\nWe make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of independent \\nbottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and retailers as well as the Company’s consolidated bottling and distribution \\noperations. Beverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to us account for 2.2 billion of the estimated 64 billion servings \\nof all beverages consumed worldwide every day.\\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nBasis of Presentation\\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally \\naccepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make \\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of \\ncontingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Although these estimates are \\nbased on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from \\nthese estimates and assumptions. Furthermore, when testing assets for impairment in future periods, if management uses \\ndifferent assumptions or if different conditions occur, impairment charges may result.\\nPrinciples of Consolidation\\nOur Company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest. Additionally, there are \\nsituations in which consolidation is required even though the usual condition of consolidation (i.e., ownership of a majority \\nvoting interest) does not apply. Generally, this occurs when an entity holds an interest in another business enterprise that was \\nachieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests, which results in a disproportionate relationship between \\nsuch entity’s voting interests in, and its exposure to the economic risks and potential rewards of, the other business enterprise. \\nThis disproportionate relationship results in what is known as a variable interest, and the entity in which another entity holds a \\nvariable interest is referred to as a “VIE.” An enterprise must consolidate a VIE if it is determined to be the primary beneficiary \\nof the VIE. The primary beneficiary has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the \\nentity’s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could \\npotentially be significant to the VIE.\\nOur Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling operations, for which we were not determined to be the \\nprimary beneficiary. Our variable interests in these VIEs primarily relate to equity investments, profit guarantees or \\nsubordinated financial support. Refer to Note 12. Although these financial arrangements resulted in our holding variable \\ninterests in these entities, they did not empower us to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs’ \\neconomic performance. Our Company’s investments, plus any loans and guarantees, and other subordinated financial support \\nrelated to these VIEs totaled $1,225 million and $1,626 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, representing \\nour maximum exposures to loss. The Company’s investments, plus any loans and guarantees, related to these VIEs were not \\nindividually significant to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\\nIn addition, our Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling operations, for which we were determined to be the \\nprimary beneficiary. As a result, we have consolidated these entities. Our Company’s investments, plus any loans and \\nguarantees, related to these VIEs totaled $88 million and $109 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, \\nrepresenting our maximum exposures to loss. The assets and liabilities of VIEs for which we are the primary beneficiary were \\nnot significant to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\\nCreditors of our VIEs do not have recourse against the general credit of the Company, regardless of whether the VIEs are \\naccounted for as consolidated entities.\\n66\\nWe use the equity method to account for investments in companies if our investment provides us with the ability to exercise \\nsignificant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee. Our consolidated net income includes our \\nCompany’s proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies. Our judgment regarding the level of influence \\nover each equity method investee includes considering key factors, such as our ownership interest, representation on the board \\nof directors, participation in policy-making decisions, other commercial arrangements and material intercompany transactions.\\nWe eliminate from our financial results all significant intercompany transactions, including the intercompany transactions with \\nconsolidated VIEs and the intercompany portion of transactions with equity method investees.\\nRevenue Recognition \\nOur Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations under the terms of the contracts with our customers are \\nsatisfied. Our performance obligation generally consists of the promise to sell concentrates, syrups or finished products to our \\nbottling partners, wholesalers, distributors or retailers. Refer to Note 3. \\nAdvertising Costs\\nOur Company expenses production costs of print, radio, television and other advertisements as of the first date the \\nadvertisements take place. All other marketing expenditures are expensed in the annual period in which the expenditure is \\nincurred. Advertising costs included in the line item selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements \\nof income were $5 billion, $4 billion and $4 billion in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, \\nadvertising and production costs of $43 million and $35 million, respectively, were primarily recorded in the line item prepaid \\nexpenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\\nShipping and Handling Costs\\nShipping and handling costs related to the movement of goods from our manufacturing locations to our sales distribution \\ncenters are included in the line item cost of goods sold in our consolidated statement of income. Shipping and handling costs \\nincurred to move goods from our manufacturing locations or sales distribution centers to our customers are also included in the \\nline item cost of goods sold in our consolidated statement of income, except for costs incurred to distribute goods sold by our \\nconsolidated bottlers to our customers, which are included in the line item selling, general and administrative expenses in our \\nconsolidated statement of income. Our customers generally do not pay us separately for shipping and handling costs. We \\nrecognize the cost of shipping and handling activities that are performed after a customer obtains control of the goods as costs \\nto fulfill our promise to provide goods to the customer. As a result of this election, the Company does not evaluate whether \\nshipping and handling activities are services promised to customers. If revenue is recognized for the related goods before the \\nshipping and handling activities occur, the related costs of those shipping and handling activities are accrued.\\nSales, Use, Value-Added and Excise Taxes\\nThe Company collects taxes imposed directly on its customers related to sales, use, value-added, excise and other similar taxes. \\nThe Company then remits such taxes on behalf of its customers to the applicable governmental authorities. We exclude from \\nnet operating revenues the tax amounts imposed on revenue-producing transactions that were collected from our customers to \\nbe remitted to governmental authorities. Accordingly, such tax amounts are recorded in the line item trade accounts receivable \\nin our consolidated balance sheet when collection of taxes from the customer has not yet occurred and are recorded in the line \\nitem accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet until they are remitted to the applicable \\ngovernmental authorities. Taxes imposed directly on the Company, whether based on receipts from sales, inventory \\nprocurement costs or manufacturing activities, are recorded in the line item cost of goods sold in our consolidated statement of \\nincome. \\nNet Income Per Share\\nBasic net income per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to shareowners of The Coca-Cola Company by the \\nweighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted net income per share is computed \\nsimilarly to basic net income per share, except that it includes the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities were \\nexercised. We excluded 8 million, 8 million and 6 million stock options from the computation of diluted net income per share in \\n2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, because the stock options would have been antidilutive. \\nCash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents\\nWe classify time deposits and other investments that are highly liquid and have maturities of three months or less at the date of \\npurchase as cash equivalents or restricted cash equivalents, as applicable. Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents \\ngenerally consist of amounts held by our captive insurance companies, which are included in the line item other noncurrent \\nassets in our consolidated balance sheet. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit \\nstandards, diversification of counterparties and procedures to monitor our concentrations of credit risk. \\n67\\nThe following table provides a summary of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents that constitute \\nthe total amounts shown in our consolidated statements of cash flows (in millions):\\nDecember 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nCash and cash equivalents\\n$ \\n9,366 $ \\n9,519 $ \\n9,684 \\nRestricted cash and restricted cash equivalents1,2\\n \\n326  \\n306  \\n341 \\nCash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents\\n$ \\n9,692 $ \\n9,825 $ \\n10,025 \\n1 Amounts include cash and cash equivalents in our solvency capital portfolio, which are included in the line item other noncurrent assets in \\nour consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 4.\\n2 Amounts include cash and cash equivalents related to assets held for sale, which are included in the line item prepaid expenses and other \\ncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 2. \\nShort-Term Investments\\nWe classify time deposits and other investments that have maturities of greater than three months but less than one year as \\nshort-term investments.\\nInvestments in Equity and Debt Securities\\nWe measure all equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair \\nvalue with the change in fair value included in net income. We use quoted market prices to determine the fair value of equity \\nsecurities with readily determinable fair values. For equity securities without readily determinable fair values, we have elected \\nthe measurement alternative under which we measure these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus \\nchanges resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same \\nissuer. Management assesses each of these investments on an individual basis. Our investments in debt securities are carried at \\neither amortized cost or fair value. Investments in debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to \\nmaturity are carried at amortized cost and classified as held-to-maturity. Investments in debt securities that are not classified as \\nheld-to-maturity are carried at fair value and classified as either trading or available-for-sale. Refer to Note 4 for additional \\ninformation on our policy for investments, which includes our assessment of impairments. \\nTrade Accounts Receivable\\nWe record trade accounts receivable at net realizable value. This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated \\nuncollectible accounts to reflect any expected loss on the trade accounts receivable balances and charged to the provision for \\ndoubtful accounts. We calculate this allowance based on available relevant information, in addition to historical loss \\ninformation, the level of past-due accounts based on the contractual terms of the receivables, and our relationships with, and the \\neconomic status of, our bottling partners and customers. We believe our exposure to concentrations of credit risk is limited due \\nto the diverse geographic areas covered by our operations. \\nThe Company has a trade accounts receivable factoring program in certain countries. Under this program, we can elect to sell \\ntrade accounts receivables to unaffiliated financial institutions at a discount. In these factoring arrangements, for ease of \\nadministration, the Company collects customer payments related to the factored receivables and remits those payments to the \\nfinancial institutions. The Company sold $17,704 million and $10,709 million of trade accounts receivables under this program \\nduring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The costs of factoring such receivables were $83 million and \\n$27 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company accounts for this program as a sale, \\nand accordingly, the trade receivables sold are excluded from the line item trade accounts receivable in our consolidated \\nbalance sheet. The cash received from the financial institutions is classified within the operating activities section in our \\nconsolidated statement of cash flows.\\nInventories\\nInventories consist primarily of raw materials and packaging (which include ingredients and supplies) and finished goods \\n(which include concentrates and syrups in our concentrate operations and finished beverages in our finished product \\noperations). Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We determine cost on the basis of the average \\ncost or first-in, first-out methods. \\n68\\nInventories consisted of the following (in millions):\\nDecember 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\nRaw materials and packaging\\n$ \\n2,618 $ \\n2,627 \\nFinished goods\\n \\n1,449  \\n1,247 \\nOther\\n \\n357  \\n359 \\nTotal inventories\\n$ \\n4,424 $ \\n4,233 \\nDerivative Instruments\\nWhen deemed appropriate, our Company uses derivatives as a risk management tool to mitigate the potential impact of certain \\nmarket risks. The primary market risks managed by the Company through the use of derivative instruments are foreign currency \\nexchange rate risk, commodity price risk and interest rate risk. All derivatives are carried at fair value in our consolidated \\nbalance sheet in the following line items, as applicable: prepaid expenses and other current assets; other noncurrent assets; \\naccounts payable and accrued expenses; and other noncurrent liabilities. The cash flow impact of the Company’s derivative \\ninstruments is primarily included in our consolidated statement of cash flows in net cash provided by operating activities. Refer \\nto Note 5.\\nLeases \\nWe determine if a contract contains a lease at its inception based on whether or not the Company has the right to control the \\nasset during the contract period and other facts and circumstances. We are the lessee in a lease contract when we obtain the \\nright to control the asset. Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease \\nterm and are included in the line item other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease liabilities \\nrepresent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease and are included in the line items accounts payable and \\naccrued expenses and other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease ROU assets and operating \\nlease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the \\ncommencement date. When determining the lease term, we include renewal or termination options that we are reasonably \\ncertain to exercise. Leases with a lease term of 12 months or less at inception are not recorded in our consolidated balance \\nsheet. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term in our consolidated statement of \\nincome. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, we use our local incremental borrowing rate based on the \\ninformation available at the commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. When our contracts \\ncontain lease and non-lease components, we account for both components as a single lease component. Refer to Note 10.\\nWe have various contracts for certain fountain equipment under which we are the lessor. These leases meet the criteria for \\noperating lease classification. Lease income associated with these leases is not material.\\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Repair and maintenance costs that do not improve service potential or extend \\neconomic life are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is recorded principally by the straight-line method over the estimated \\nuseful lives of our assets, which are reviewed periodically and generally have the following ranges: buildings and \\nimprovements: 40 years or less; and machinery and equipment: 20 years or less. Land is not depreciated, and construction in \\nprogress is not depreciated until ready for service. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over \\nthe shorter of the remaining lease term, including renewal options that we are reasonably certain to exercise, or the estimated \\nuseful life of the improvement. Depreciation is not recorded during the period in which a long-lived asset or disposal group is \\nclassified as held for sale, even if the asset or disposal group continues to generate revenue during the period. Depreciation \\nexpense, including the depreciation expense of assets under finance leases, totaled $1,018 million, $1,125 million and \\n$1,262 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Amortization expense for leasehold improvements totaled $14 million, \\n$13 million and $15 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \\n69\\nThe following table summarizes our property, plant and equipment (in millions):\\nDecember 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\nLand\\n$ \\n229 $ \\n611 \\nBuildings and improvements\\n \\n4,647  \\n4,434 \\nMachinery and equipment\\n \\n13,593  \\n14,030 \\nProperty, plant and equipment — cost\\n \\n18,469  \\n19,075 \\nLess: Accumulated depreciation\\n \\n9,233  \\n9,234 \\nProperty, plant and equipment — net\\n$ \\n9,236 $ \\n9,841 \\nCertain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount of property, plant and \\nequipment should be assessed, including, among others, a significant decrease in market value, a significant change in the \\nbusiness climate in a particular market, or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses or \\nprojected future losses. When such events or changes in circumstances are present and a recoverability test is performed, we \\nestimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. These \\nestimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash \\nflows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment charge. The \\nimpairment charge recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the fair value. \\nWe use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of property, plant and equipment, including appraisals and \\ndiscounted cash flow models. These appraisals and models include assumptions we believe are consistent with those a market \\nparticipant would use.\\nGoodwill, Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets\\nWe classify intangible assets into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization; (2) intangible \\nassets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization; and (3) goodwill. We determine the useful lives of our identifiable \\nintangible assets after considering the specific facts and circumstances related to each intangible asset. Factors we consider \\nwhen determining useful lives include the contractual term of any agreement related to the asset, the historical performance of \\nthe asset, the Company’s long-term strategy for using the asset, any laws or other local regulations which could impact the \\nuseful life of the asset, and other economic factors, including competition and specific market conditions. Intangible assets that \\nare deemed to have definite lives are amortized, primarily on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, which is less than     \\n20 years. Refer to Note 7.\\nWhen events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of definite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable, \\nmanagement performs a recoverability test of the carrying value by preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting profit \\nand cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. These estimated future \\ncash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted \\nand without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment charge. The impairment charge \\nrecognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of \\nmethodologies to determine the fair value of these assets, including discounted cash flow models, which include assumptions \\nwe believe are consistent with those a market participant would use.\\nWe test intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives, including trademarks, franchise rights and goodwill, for \\nimpairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired. Our Company \\nperforms these annual impairment tests as of the first day of our third fiscal quarter. We perform impairment tests using various \\nvaluation methodologies, including discounted cash flow models and a market approach, to determine the fair value of the \\nindefinite-lived intangible asset or the reporting unit, as applicable. We believe our assumptions are consistent with those a \\nmarket participant would use. For indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair \\nvalue, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The Company has the option to perform a \\nqualitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, rather than completing the impairment test. The \\nCompany must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying \\namount. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing described above. Otherwise, the \\nCompany does not need to perform any further assessment. \\nWe perform impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level, which is generally one level below our operating \\nsegments. Our operating segments are primarily based on geographic responsibility, which is consistent with the way \\nmanagement runs our business. Our geographic operating segments are generally subdivided into smaller geographic regions. \\nThese geographic regions are our reporting units. Our Global Ventures operating segment includes the results of our Costa \\nLimited (“Costa”), innocent and doğadan businesses, as well as fees earned pursuant to distribution coordination agreements \\n70\\nbetween the Company and Monster Beverage Corporation (“Monster”), each of which is its own reporting unit. The Bottling \\nInvestments operating segment includes all of our consolidated bottling operations, regardless of geographic location. \\nGenerally, each consolidated bottling operation within our Bottling Investments operating segment is its own reporting unit. \\nGoodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or units that benefit from the synergies arising from each business combination.\\nIn order to test for goodwill impairment, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, \\nincluding goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is written down for the \\namount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. However, the impairment charge recognized cannot exceed the \\ncarrying amount of goodwill. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill in order to \\ndetermine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the \\nCompany concludes that this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing discussed above. Otherwise, the Company does \\nnot need to perform any further assessment. \\nImpairment charges related to intangible assets, including goodwill, are generally recorded in the line item other operating \\ncharges or, to the extent they relate to equity method investees, in the line item equity income (loss) — net in our consolidated \\nstatement of income.\\nContingencies\\nOur Company is involved in various legal proceedings and tax matters. Due to their nature, such legal proceedings and tax \\nmatters involve inherent uncertainties, including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties and \\ngovernmental actions. Management assesses the probability of loss for such contingencies and accrues a liability and/or \\ndiscloses the relevant circumstances, as appropriate. Refer to Note 12.\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nOur Company grants long-term equity awards under its stock-based compensation plans to certain employees of the Company. \\nThese awards include stock options, performance share units, restricted stock and restricted stock units. The fair value of stock \\noption awards is estimated using a Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The Company recognizes compensation \\nexpense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is generally four years.\\nThe fair value of restricted stock, restricted stock units and certain performance share units is the closing market price per share \\nof the Company’s stock on the grant date less the present value of the expected dividends not received during the vesting \\nperiod. The Company included a relative total shareowner return (“TSR”) modifier for performance share unit awards granted \\nto executives from 2018 through 2022 as well as for performance share unit awards granted to all participants in 2023. For these \\nawards, the number of performance share units earned based on the certified achievement of the predefined performance criteria \\nwill be reduced or increased if the Company’s total shareowner return over the performance period relative to a predefined \\ngroup of companies falls outside of a predefined range. The fair value of performance share units that include a TSR modifier is \\ndetermined using a Monte Carlo valuation model. \\nIn the reporting period it becomes probable that the minimum performance threshold specified in the performance share unit \\naward will be achieved, we recognize compensation expense for the proportionate share of the total fair value of the \\nperformance share units related to the vesting period that has already lapsed for the performance share units expected to vest. \\nThe remaining fair value of the performance share units expected to vest is expensed on a straight-line basis over the remainder \\nof the vesting period. In the event the Company determines it is no longer probable that the minimum performance threshold \\nspecified in the award will be achieved, we reverse all of the previously recognized compensation expense in the reporting \\nperiod such a determination is made. \\nThe Company has made a policy election to estimate the number of stock-based compensation awards that will ultimately vest \\nto determine the amount of compensation expense recognized each reporting period. Forfeiture estimates are trued-up at the end \\nof each quarter in order to ensure that compensation expense is recognized only for those awards that ultimately vest. Refer to \\nNote 13.\\nIncome Taxes\\nIncome tax expense includes U.S., state, local and international income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized \\nfor the tax consequences of temporary differences between the book basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The tax rate \\nused to determine the deferred tax assets and liabilities is the enacted tax rate for the year and manner in which the differences \\nare expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than \\nnot be realized. \\nThe Company is involved in various tax matters, with respect to some of which the outcome is uncertain. We establish reserves \\nto remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that it becomes uncertain based \\n71\\nupon one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is not “more likely than not” to be sustained; (2) the tax position is \\n“more likely than not” to be sustained, but for a lesser amount; or (3) the tax position is “more likely than not” to be sustained, \\nbut not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken. For purposes of evaluating whether or not a tax \\nposition is uncertain, (1) we presume the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge \\nof all relevant information; (2) the technical merits of a tax position are derived from authorities such as legislation and statutes, \\nlegislative intent, regulations, rulings and caselaw and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position; and \\n(3) each tax position is evaluated without consideration of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other tax positions taken. \\nA number of years may elapse before a particular uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved or when a tax assessment \\nis raised. The number of years subject to tax assessments varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been \\npreviously reserved because of a failure to meet the “more likely than not” recognition threshold would be recognized in \\nincome tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears under any one of the following conditions: \\n(1) the tax position is “more likely than not” to be sustained; (2) the tax position, amount and/or timing is ultimately settled \\nthrough negotiation or litigation; or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Refer to Note 12 and Note 15.\\nTranslation and Remeasurement\\nWe translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries from their respective functional currencies to U.S. dollars at the \\nappropriate spot rates as of the balance sheet date. Generally, our foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional \\ncurrency. Changes in the carrying values of these assets and liabilities attributable to fluctuations in spot rates are recognized in \\nnet foreign currency translation adjustments, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”). Refer \\nto Note 16. Accounts in our consolidated statement of income are translated using the monthly average exchange rates during \\nthe year.\\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency that is different from a reporting entity’s functional currency must be \\nremeasured from the applicable currency to the reporting entity’s functional currency. The effects of the remeasurement of \\nthese assets and liabilities are recognized in the line item other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income and \\nare partially offset by the impact of our economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated balance sheet. \\nRefer to Note 5.\\nRecently Issued Accounting Guidance\\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic \\n280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which expands annual and interim disclosure requirements for \\nreportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The expanded annual \\ndisclosures are effective for our year ending December 31, 2024, and the expanded interim disclosures are effective in 2025 and \\nwill be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2023-07 \\nwill have on our consolidated financial statements.\\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, \\nwhich requires, among other things, additional disclosures primarily related to the income tax rate reconciliation and income \\ntaxes paid. The expanded annual disclosures are effective for our year ending December 31, 2025. The Company is currently \\nevaluating the impact that ASU 2023-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and whether we will apply the \\nstandard prospectively or retrospectively.\\nNOTE 2: ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES \\nAcquisitions\\nOur Company’s acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $62 million and \\n$73 million during 2023 and 2022, respectively. During 2021, our Company’s acquisitions of businesses, equity method \\ninvestments and nonmarketable securities totaled $4,766 million, which primarily related to the acquisition of the remaining \\nownership interest in BA Sports Nutrition, LLC (“BodyArmor”).\\nBA Sports Nutrition, LLC \\nIn November 2021, the Company acquired the remaining 85% ownership interest in, and now owns 100% of, BodyArmor, \\nwhich offers a line of sports performance and hydration beverages in the United States. We acquired the remaining ownership \\ninterest in exchange for approximately $5,600 million of cash, of which $4,745 million was paid at close, net of cash acquired. \\nThe purchase price reflected the contractual discount included in the purchase option we obtained with our initial investment in \\n2018. The remaining $860 million of the purchase price was held back related to indemnification obligations, of which \\n$549 million had been paid as of December 31, 2022 and $311 million was paid in 2023. Upon consolidation, we recognized a \\ngain of $834 million resulting from the remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in BodyArmor to fair value, which \\n72\\nwas recorded in the line item other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income. The fair value of our \\npreviously held equity interest was determined using a discounted cash flow model based on Level 3 inputs, as defined in \\nNote 17. Upon finalization of purchase accounting, $4.2 billion of the purchase price was allocated to the BodyArmor \\ntrademark and $2.2 billion was allocated to goodwill, of which $1.2 billion is tax deductible. The goodwill recognized as part of \\nthis acquisition is primarily related to the synergistic value created from leveraging the capabilities, assets and scale of the \\nCompany and the opportunity for international expansion. It also includes certain other intangible assets that do not qualify for \\nseparate recognition, such as an assembled workforce. Of the total amount allocated to goodwill, $1.9 billion has been assigned \\nto the North America operating segment and $0.3 billion has been assigned to our other geographic operating segments. \\nDivestitures\\nDuring 2023, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled \\n$430 million, which primarily related to sales of our ownership interests in our equity method investees in Indonesia and \\nPakistan, for which we received cash proceeds of $402 million and a note receivable of $200 million. We recognized a net gain \\nof $94 million as a result of these transactions.\\nDuring 2022, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled \\n$458 million, which primarily related to the refranchising of our bottling operations in Cambodia. We received net cash \\nproceeds of $228 million and recognized a net gain of $153 million as a result of the refranchising. Also included was the sale \\nof our ownership interest in one of our equity method investees, for which we received cash proceeds of $123 million and \\nrecognized a net gain of $13 million.\\nDuring 2021, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled \\n$2,180 million, which primarily related to the sale of our ownership interest in Coca-Cola Amatil Limited (“CCA”), an equity \\nmethod investee, to Coca-Cola Europacific Partners plc (“CCEP”), also an equity method investee. We received cash proceeds \\nof $1,738 million and recognized a net gain of $695 million as a result of the sale and the related reversal of cumulative \\ntranslation adjustments. Also included were the sale of our ownership interest in an equity method investee and the sale of a \\nportion of our ownership interest in another equity method investee. We received cash proceeds of $293 million and recognized \\na net gain of $114 million as a result of these sales. \\nAll of the gains and losses discussed above were recorded in the line item other income (loss) — net in our consolidated \\nstatements of income.\\nAssets and Liabilities Held for Sale\\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company’s bottling operations in the Philippines and Bangladesh and certain bottling operations \\nin India met the criteria to be classified as held for sale and are expected to be refranchised during the first quarter of 2024. As \\nof December 31, 2022, the Company’s bottling operations in Vietnam met the criteria to be classified as held for sale. As a \\nresult, we were required to record the related assets and liabilities at the lower of carrying value or fair value less any costs to \\nsell. As the fair values less any costs to sell exceeded the carrying values, the related assets and liabilities were recorded at their \\ncarrying values. These assets and liabilities were included in the Bottling Investments operating segment. \\nIn December 2022, the Company received cash proceeds of $823 million in advance of refranchising its bottling operations in \\nVietnam. This advance was included in the line item accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet \\nas of December 31, 2022, and was included in the line item other investing activities in our consolidated statement of cash \\nflows for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company refranchised its bottling operations in Vietnam in January 2023 and \\nrecognized a net gain of $439 million as a result of the sale, which was recorded in the line item other income (loss) — net in \\nour consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2023. \\n73\\nThe following table presents information related to the major classes of assets and liabilities that were classified as held for sale \\nand were included in the line items prepaid expenses and other current assets and accounts payable and accrued expenses, \\nrespectively, in our consolidated balance sheets (in millions):\\nDecember 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments\\n$ \\n37 $ \\n229 \\nMarketable securities\\n \\n8  \\n— \\nTrade accounts receivable, less allowances\\n \\n95  \\n12 \\nInventories\\n \\n299  \\n50 \\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\\n \\n60  \\n43 \\nEquity method investments\\n \\n4  \\n— \\nOther noncurrent assets\\n \\n51  \\n29 \\nDeferred income tax assets\\n \\n28  \\n8 \\nProperty, plant and equipment — net\\n \\n1,267  \\n197 \\nGoodwill\\n \\n231  \\n34 \\nOther intangible assets\\n \\n14  \\n— \\n  Assets held for sale\\n$ \\n2,094 $ \\n602 \\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\\n$ \\n464 $ \\n154 \\nLoans and notes payable\\n \\n63  \\n— \\nAccrued income taxes\\n \\n24  \\n3 \\nLong-term debt\\n \\n2  \\n— \\nOther noncurrent liabilities\\n \\n108  \\n3 \\nDeferred income tax liabilities\\n \\n58  \\n— \\n  Liabilities held for sale\\n$ \\n719 $ \\n160 \\nNOTE 3: NET OPERATING REVENUES \\nOur Company operates in two lines of business: concentrate operations and finished product operations.\\nOur concentrate operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as \\n“beverage bases,” syrups, including fountain syrups, and certain finished beverages to authorized bottling operations (to which \\nwe typically refer as our “bottlers” or our “bottling partners”). Our bottling partners either combine concentrates with still or \\nsparkling water and sweeteners (depending on the product), or combine syrups with still or sparkling water, to produce finished \\nbeverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers, such as cans and refillable and nonrefillable glass and \\nplastic bottles, bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, \\nthrough wholesalers or other bottlers. In addition, outside the United States, our bottling partners are typically authorized to \\nmanufacture fountain syrups, using our concentrates, which they sell to fountain retailers for use in producing beverages for \\nimmediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain \\nretailers. Our concentrate operations are included in our geographic operating segments and our Global Ventures operating \\nsegment.\\nOur finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling soft drinks and a variety of other finished \\nbeverages to retailers, or to distributors and wholesalers who in turn sell the beverages to retailers. Generally, finished product \\noperations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations. These operations \\nconsist primarily of our consolidated bottling and distribution operations, which are included in our Bottling Investments \\noperating segment. In certain markets, the Company also operates non-bottling finished product operations in which we sell \\nfinished beverages to distributors and wholesalers that are generally not one of the Company’s bottling partners. These \\noperations are generally included in one of our geographic operating segments or our Global Ventures operating segment. \\nAdditionally, we sell directly to consumers through retail stores operated by Costa. These sales are included in our Global \\nVentures operating segment. In the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers, who use \\nthe fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners \\nwho in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. These fountain syrup sales are included in our North \\nAmerica operating segment.\\n74\\nRevenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contracts with our customers are satisfied. Our \\nperformance obligation generally consists of the promise to sell concentrates, syrups or finished products to our bottling \\npartners, wholesalers, distributors or retailers. Control of the concentrates, syrups or finished products is transferred upon \\nshipment to, or receipt at, our customers’ locations, as determined by the specific terms of the contract. Upon transfer of control \\nto the customer, which completes our performance obligation, revenue is recognized. Our sales terms generally do not allow for \\na right of return except for matters related to any manufacturing defects on our part. After completion of our performance \\nobligation, we have an unconditional right to consideration as outlined in the contract. Our receivables will generally be \\ncollected in less than six months, in accordance with the underlying payment terms. All of our performance obligations under \\nthe terms of contracts with our customers have an original duration of one year or less.\\nOur customers and bottling partners may be entitled to cash discounts, funds for promotional and marketing activities, volume-\\nbased incentive programs, support for infrastructure programs and other similar programs. In most markets, in an effort to allow \\nour Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility \\nnecessary to meet consumers’ always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing \\nmodel. Under this model, the price we charge bottlers for concentrates they use to prepare and package finished products is \\nimpacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the prices charged by the bottlers for such finished products, the \\nchannels in which they are sold, and package mix. The amounts associated with the arrangements described above represent \\nvariable consideration, an estimate of which is included in the transaction price as a component of net operating revenues in our \\nconsolidated statement of income upon completion of our performance obligations. The total revenue recorded, including any \\nvariable consideration, cannot exceed the amount for which it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur when \\nuncertainties related to variability are resolved. As a result, we are recognizing revenue based on our faithful depiction of the \\nconsideration that we expect to receive. In making our estimates of variable consideration, we consider past results and make \\nsignificant assumptions related to: (1) customer sales volumes; (2) customer ending inventories; (3) customer selling price per \\nunit; (4) selling channels; and (5) discount rates, rebates and other pricing allowances, as applicable. In gathering data to \\nestimate our variable consideration, we generally calculate our estimates using a portfolio approach at the country and product \\nline level rather than at the individual contract level. The result of making these estimates will impact the line items trade \\naccounts receivable or accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet, as applicable. The actual \\namounts ultimately paid and/or received may be different from our estimates. The change in the amount of variable \\nconsideration recognized during the year ended December 31, 2023 related to performance obligations satisfied in prior periods \\nwas immaterial.\\nThe following table presents net operating revenues disaggregated between the United States and International and further by \\nline of business (in millions):\\nUnited States\\nInternational\\nTotal\\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\\nConcentrate operations\\n$ \\n8,780 $ \\n17,759 $ \\n26,539 \\nFinished product operations\\n \\n7,770  \\n11,445  \\n19,215 \\nTotal \\n$ \\n16,550 $ \\n29,204 $ \\n45,754 \\nYear Ended December 31, 2022\\nConcentrate operations\\n$ \\n7,702 $ \\n16,369 $ \\n24,071 \\nFinished product operations\\n \\n7,711  \\n11,222  \\n18,933 \\nTotal \\n$ \\n15,413 $ \\n27,591 $ \\n43,004 \\nYear Ended December 31, 2021\\nConcentrate operations\\n$ \\n6,551 $ \\n15,248 $ \\n21,799 \\nFinished product operations\\n \\n6,459  \\n10,397  \\n16,856 \\nTotal\\n$ \\n13,010 $ \\n25,645 $ \\n38,655 \\nRefer to Note 20 for additional revenue disclosures by operating segment and Corporate.\\n75\\nNOTE 4: INVESTMENTS \\nWe measure all equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair \\nvalue with the change in fair value included in net income. We use quoted market prices to determine the fair values of equity \\nsecurities with readily determinable fair values. For equity securities without readily determinable fair values, we have elected \\nthe measurement alternative under which we measure these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus \\nchanges resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same \\nissuer. Management assesses each of these investments on an individual basis.\\nOur investments in debt securities are carried at either amortized cost or fair value. The cost basis is determined by the specific \\nidentification method. Investments in debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are \\ncarried at amortized cost and classified as held-to-maturity. Investments in debt securities that are not classified as held-to-\\nmaturity are carried at fair value and classified as either trading or available-for-sale. Realized and unrealized gains and losses \\non trading debt securities as well as realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are included in net income. \\nUnrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on available-for-sale debt securities are included in our consolidated balance sheet as a \\ncomponent of AOCI, except for the changes in fair values attributable to the currency risk being hedged, if applicable, which \\nare included in net income. Refer to Note 5 for additional information related to the Company’s fair value hedges of available-\\nfor-sale debt securities.\\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity method and debt securities \\nclassified as trading are not assessed for impairment, since they are carried at fair value with the change in fair value included in \\nnet income. Equity method investments, equity securities without readily determinable fair values and debt securities classified \\nas available-for-sale or held-to-maturity are reviewed each reporting period to determine whether a significant event or change \\nin circumstances has occurred that may have an adverse effect on the fair value of each investment. When such events or \\nchanges occur, we evaluate the fair value compared to our cost basis in the investment. We also perform this evaluation every \\nreporting period for each investment for which our cost basis has exceeded the fair value. The fair values of most of our \\nCompany’s investments in publicly traded companies are readily available based on quoted market prices. For investments in \\nnonpublicly traded companies, management’s assessment of fair value is based on various valuation methodologies, including \\ndiscounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds, and appraisals, as appropriate. We consider the assumptions that we believe \\na market participant would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or estimates \\nof sales proceeds valuation methodologies. The ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in emerging and \\ndeveloping markets, may impact the determination of fair value. In the event the fair value of an investment declines below our \\ncost basis, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. If management determines \\nthe decline is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. Management’s assessment as to the nature of a decline in \\nfair value is based on, among other things, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our \\ncost basis; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a \\nperiod of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.\\nEquity Securities\\nThe carrying values of our equity securities were included in the following line items in our consolidated balance sheets (in \\nmillions):\\nFair Value with \\nChanges \\nRecognized in \\nIncome\\nMeasurement \\nAlternative — \\nNo Readily \\nDeterminable\\nFair Value\\nDecember 31, 2023\\nMarketable securities\\n$ \\n345 $ \\n— \\nOther investments\\n \\n76  \\n42 \\nOther noncurrent assets\\n \\n1,585  \\n— \\nTotal equity securities\\n$ \\n2,006 $ \\n42 \\nDecember 31, 2022\\nMarketable securities\\n$ \\n308 $ \\n— \\nOther investments\\n \\n459  \\n42 \\nOther noncurrent assets\\n \\n1,303  \\n— \\nTotal equity securities\\n$ \\n2,070 $ \\n42 \\n76\\nThe calculation of net unrealized gains and losses recognized during the year related to equity securities still held at the end of \\nthe year is as follows (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31, \\n2023\\n2022\\nNet gains (losses) recognized during the year related to equity securities  \\n$ \\n371 $ \\n(236) \\nLess: Net gains (losses) recognized during the year related to equity securities sold during\\n   the year \\n \\n52  \\n7 \\nNet unrealized gains (losses) recognized during the year related to equity securities still held at\\n   the end of the year\\n$ \\n319 $ \\n(243) \\nDebt Securities\\nOur debt securities consisted of the following (in millions):\\nGross Unrealized\\nEstimated Fair \\nValue\\nCost\\nGains\\nLosses\\nDecember 31, 2023\\nTrading securities\\n$ \\n43 $ \\n— $ \\n(2) $ \\n41 \\nAvailable-for-sale securities\\n \\n1,136  \\n26  \\n(28)  \\n1,134 \\nTotal debt securities\\n$ \\n1,179 $ \\n26 $ \\n(30) $ \\n1,175 \\nDecember 31, 2022\\nTrading securities\\n$ \\n43 $ \\n— $ \\n(4) $ \\n39 \\nAvailable-for-sale securities\\n \\n979  \\n26  \\n(61)  \\n944 \\nTotal debt securities\\n$ \\n1,022 $ \\n26 $ \\n(65) $ \\n983 \\nThe carrying values of our debt securities were included in the following line items in our consolidated balance sheets (in \\nmillions):\\nDecember 31, 2023\\nDecember 31, 2022\\nTrading \\nSecurities\\nAvailable-for-\\nSale Securities\\nTrading \\nSecurities\\nAvailable-for-\\nSale Securities\\nMarketable securities\\n$ \\n41 $ \\n914 \\n$ \\n39 $ \\n722 \\nOther noncurrent assets\\n \\n—  \\n220 \\n \\n—  \\n222 \\nTotal debt securities\\n$ \\n41 $ \\n1,134 \\n$ \\n39 $ \\n944 \\nThe contractual maturities of these available-for-sale debt securities as of December 31, 2023 were as follows (in millions):\\nCost\\nEstimated \\nFair Value\\nWithin 1 year\\n$ \\n484 $ \\n483 \\nAfter 1 year through 5 years\\n \\n420  \\n427 \\nAfter 5 years through 10 years\\n \\n37  \\n48 \\nAfter 10 years\\n \\n195  \\n176 \\nTotal\\n$ \\n1,136 $ \\n1,134 \\nThe Company expects that actual maturities may differ from the contractual maturities above because borrowers have the right \\nto call or prepay certain obligations.\\nThe sale and/or maturity of available-for-sale debt securities resulted in the following realized activity (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nGross gains\\n$ \\n3 $ \\n5 $ \\n6 \\nGross losses\\n \\n(10)  \\n(136)  \\n(10) \\nProceeds\\n \\n361  \\n1,498  \\n1,197 \\n77\\nCaptive Insurance Companies\\nIn accordance with local insurance regulations, our consolidated captive insurance companies are required to meet and maintain \\nminimum solvency capital requirements.

This captive’s solvency capital funds included total equity and debt securities of \\n$1,643 million and $1,378 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which were classified in the line item other \\nnoncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheets because the assets were not available to satisfy our current obligations.\\nNOTE 5: HEDGING TRANSACTIONS AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \\nThe Company is directly and indirectly affected by changes in certain market conditions. These changes in market conditions \\nmay adversely impact the Company’s financial performance and are referred to as “market risks.” When deemed appropriate, \\nour Company uses derivatives as a risk management tool to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks. The primary \\nmarket risks managed by the Company through the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments are foreign \\ncurrency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk and interest rate risk.\\nThe Company uses various types of derivative instruments, including, but not limited to, forward contracts, commodity futures \\ncontracts, option contracts, collars and swaps. Forward contracts and commodity futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell \\na quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined future date and at a predetermined rate or price. An option contract is \\nan agreement that conveys the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at \\na predetermined rate or price during a period or at a time in the future. A collar is a strategy that uses a combination of options \\nto limit the range of possible positive or negative returns on an underlying asset or liability to a specific range, or to protect \\nexpected future cash flows. To do this, an investor simultaneously buys a put option and sells (writes) a call option, or \\nalternatively buys a call option and sells (writes) a put option. A swap agreement is a contract between two parties to exchange \\ncash flows based on specified underlying notional amounts, assets and/or indices. We do not enter into derivative financial \\ninstruments for trading purposes. The Company may also designate certain non-derivative instruments, such as our foreign \\ncurrency denominated third-party debt, in hedging relationships.\\nAll derivative instruments are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily in the following line items, as \\napplicable: prepaid expenses and other current assets; other noncurrent assets; accounts payable and accrued expenses; and \\nother noncurrent liabilities. The carrying values of the derivatives reflect the impact of legally enforceable master netting \\nagreements and cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparties, as applicable. These master netting agreements \\nallow the Company to net settle positive and negative positions (assets and liabilities) arising from different transactions with \\nthe same counterparty.\\nThe accounting for gains and losses that result from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments depends on whether the \\nderivatives have been designated and qualify as hedging instruments and the type of hedging relationships. Derivatives can be \\ndesignated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. The changes in the fair \\nvalues of derivatives that have been designated and qualify for fair value hedge accounting are recorded in the same line item in \\nour consolidated statement of income as the changes in the fair values of the hedged items attributable to the risk being hedged. \\nThe changes in the fair values of derivatives that have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges or hedges of net \\ninvestments in foreign operations are recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into the line item in our consolidated statement of \\nincome in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period the hedged items affect earnings. Due to the high degree of \\neffectiveness between the hedging instruments and the underlying exposures being hedged, fluctuations in the values of the \\nderivative instruments are generally offset by changes in the fair values or cash flows of the underlying exposures being \\nhedged. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that were not designated and/or did not qualify as hedging instruments are \\nimmediately recognized in earnings.\\nFor derivatives that will be accounted for as hedging instruments, the Company formally designates and documents, at \\ninception, the financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure, the risk management objective and the strategy \\nfor undertaking the hedge transaction. In addition, the Company formally assesses, both at inception and at least quarterly \\nthereafter, whether the financial instruments used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the fair \\nvalues or cash flows of the related underlying exposures. \\nThe Company determines the fair values of its derivatives based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current \\nmarket rates. Refer to Note 17. The notional amounts of the derivative financial instruments do not necessarily represent \\namounts exchanged by the parties and, therefore, are not a direct measure of our exposure to the financial risks described above. \\nThe amounts exchanged are calculated by reference to the notional amounts and by other terms of the derivatives, such as \\ninterest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity rates or other financial indices. The Company does not view the fair \\n78\\nvalues of its derivatives in isolation but rather in relation to the fair values or cash flows of the underlying hedged transactions \\nor other exposures. Virtually all of our derivatives are straightforward over-the-counter instruments with liquid markets.\\nThe following table presents the fair values of the Company’s derivative instruments that were designated and qualified as part \\nof a hedging relationship (in millions):\\n \\nFair Value1,2\\nDerivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments\\nFinancial Statement Line Item Impacted1\\nDecember 31,\\n2023\\nDecember 31,\\n2022\\nAssets:\\n \\n \\n \\nForeign currency contracts\\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\\n$ \\n109 $ \\n126 \\nForeign currency contracts\\nOther noncurrent assets\\n \\n13  \\n13 \\nInterest rate contracts\\nOther noncurrent assets\\n \\n50  \\n— \\nTotal assets\\n \\n$ \\n172 $ \\n139 \\nLiabilities:\\n \\n \\n \\nForeign currency contracts\\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\\n$ \\n111 $ \\n54 \\nForeign currency contracts\\nOther noncurrent liabilities\\n \\n40  \\n108 \\nCommodity contracts\\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\\n \\n3  \\n2 \\nInterest rate contracts\\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\\n \\n5  \\n— \\nInterest rate contracts\\nOther noncurrent liabilities\\n \\n1,113  \\n1,676 \\nTotal liabilities\\n \\n$ \\n1,272 $ \\n1,840 \\n1 All of the Company’s derivative instruments are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets after considering the impact of \\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparties, as applicable.

Refer to Note 17 for the net presentation of the Company’s derivative instruments.\\n2 Refer to Note 17 for additional information related to the estimated fair value.\\n79\\nCredit Risk Associated with Derivatives\\nWe have established strict counterparty credit guidelines and enter into transactions only with financial institutions of \\ninvestment grade or better. We monitor counterparty exposures regularly and review any downgrade in credit rating \\nimmediately. If a downgrade in the credit rating of a counterparty were to occur, we have provisions requiring collateral for \\nsubstantially all of our transactions. To mitigate presettlement risk, minimum credit standards become more stringent as the \\nduration of the derivative financial instrument increases. In addition, the Company’s master netting agreements reduce credit \\nrisk by permitting the Company to net settle for transactions with the same counterparty. To minimize the concentration of \\ncredit risk, we enter into derivative transactions with a portfolio of financial institutions. Furthermore, for certain derivative \\nfinancial instruments, the Company has agreements with counterparties that require collateral to be exchanged based on \\nchanges in the fair value of the instruments. The Company classifies collateral payments and receipts as investing cash flows \\nwhen the collateral account is in an asset position and as financing cash flows when the collateral account is in a liability \\nposition. As a result of these factors, we consider the risk of counterparty default to be minimal. \\nCash Flow Hedging Strategy\\nThe Company uses cash flow hedges to minimize the variability in cash flows of assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions \\ncaused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices or interest rates. The changes in the fair values of \\nderivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into the line item in our consolidated \\nstatement of income in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period the hedged items affect earnings. The changes \\nin fair values of hedges that are determined to be ineffective are immediately reclassified from AOCI into earnings. The \\nmaximum length of time for which the Company hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows is typically three \\nyears.\\nThe Company maintains a foreign currency cash flow hedging program to reduce the risk that our U.S. dollar net cash inflows \\nfrom sales outside the United States and U.S. dollar net cash outflows from procurement activities will be adversely affected by \\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into forward contracts and purchase foreign currency options and \\ncollars (principally euro, British pound and Japanese yen) to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in \\nforeign currencies. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against the foreign currencies, the decline in the present value of future \\nforeign currency cash flows is partially offset by gains in the fair value of the derivative instruments. Conversely, when the U.S. \\ndollar weakens, the increase in the present value of future foreign currency cash flows is partially offset by losses in the fair \\nvalue of the derivative instruments. The total notional values of derivatives that were designated and qualified for the \\nCompany’s foreign currency cash flow hedging program were $9,408 million and $5,510 million as of December 31, 2023 and \\n2022, respectively.\\nThe Company uses cross-currency swaps to hedge the changes in cash flows of certain of its foreign currency denominated debt \\nand other monetary assets or liabilities due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For this hedging program, the \\nCompany recognizes in earnings each period the changes in carrying values of these foreign currency denominated assets and \\nliabilities due to fluctuations in exchange rates. The changes in fair values of the cross-currency swap derivatives are recorded \\nin AOCI with an immediate reclassification into earnings for the changes in fair values attributable to fluctuations in foreign \\ncurrency exchange rates. The total notional value of derivatives that were designated as cash flow hedges for the Company’s \\nforeign currency denominated assets and liabilities was $958 million as of both December 31, 2023 and 2022.\\nThe Company has entered into commodity futures contracts and other derivative instruments on various commodities to \\nmitigate the price risk associated with forecasted purchases of materials used in our manufacturing process. These derivative \\ninstruments were designated as part of the Company’s commodity cash flow hedging program. The objective of this hedging \\nprogram is to reduce the variability of cash flows associated with future purchases of certain commodities. The total notional \\nvalues of derivatives that were designated and qualified for this program were $54 million and $35 million as of December 31, \\n2023 and 2022, respectively.\\nOur Company monitors our mix of short-term debt and long-term debt regularly. We manage our risk to interest rate \\nfluctuations through the use of derivative financial instruments. From time to time, the Company has entered into interest rate \\nswap agreements and has designated these instruments as part of the Company’s interest rate cash flow hedging program. The \\nobjective of this hedging program is to mitigate the risk of adverse changes in benchmark interest rates on the Company’s \\nfuture interest payments. The total notional value of derivatives that were designated and qualified for the Company’s interest \\nrate cash flow hedging program was $750 million as of December 31, 2023. There were no derivatives that were designated and \\nqualified for the Company’s interest rate cash flow hedging program as of December 31, 2022.\\n80\\nThe following table presents the pretax impact that changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges had \\non other comprehensive income (“OCI”), AOCI and earnings (in millions):\\nGain (Loss)\\nRecognized\\nin OCI\\nFinancial Statement Line Item Impacted\\nGain (Loss)\\nReclassified from\\nAOCI into Income\\n2023\\n \\n \\n \\nForeign currency contracts\\n$ \\n(128) Net operating revenues\\n$ \\n(3) \\nForeign currency contracts\\n \\n19 \\nCost of goods sold\\n \\n14 \\nForeign currency contracts\\n \\n— \\nInterest expense\\n \\n(4) \\nForeign currency contracts\\n \\n35 \\nOther income (loss) — net\\n \\n17 \\nCommodity contracts\\n \\n(15) Cost of goods sold\\n \\n(14) \\nTotal\\n$ \\n(89) \\n$ \\n10 \\n2022\\nForeign currency contracts\\n$ \\n205 \\nNet operating revenues\\n$ \\n218 \\nForeign currency contracts\\n \\n17 \\nCost of goods sold\\n \\n28 \\nForeign currency contracts\\n \\n— \\nInterest expense\\n \\n(4) \\nForeign currency contracts\\n \\n(91) Other income (loss) — net\\n \\n(79) \\nCommodity contracts\\n \\n(4) Cost of goods sold\\n \\n(2) \\nTotal\\n$ \\n127 \\n \\n$ \\n161 \\n2021\\nForeign currency contracts\\n$ \\n36 \\nNet operating revenues\\n$ \\n(77) \\nForeign currency contracts\\n \\n(2) Cost of goods sold\\n \\n(10) \\nForeign currency contracts\\n \\n— \\nInterest expense\\n \\n(13) \\nForeign currency contracts\\n \\n19 \\nOther income (loss) — net\\n \\n74 \\nInterest rate contracts\\n \\n110 \\nInterest expense\\n \\n(90) \\nCommodity contracts\\n \\n(1) Cost of goods sold\\n \\n— \\nTotal\\n$ \\n162 \\n$ \\n(116) \\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company estimates that it will reclassify into earnings during the next 12 months net losses of \\n$72 million from the pretax amount recorded in AOCI as the anticipated cash flows occur.\\nFair Value Hedging Strategy\\nThe Company uses interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges to minimize exposure to changes in the fair \\nvalue of fixed-rate debt that result from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates. The Company also uses cross-currency interest \\nrate swaps to hedge the changes in the fair value of foreign currency denominated debt relating to fluctuations in foreign \\ncurrency exchange rates and benchmark interest rates. The changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as fair value \\nhedges and the offsetting changes in the fair values of the hedged items are recognized in earnings. As a result, any difference is \\nreflected in earnings as ineffectiveness. When a derivative is no longer designated as a fair value hedge for any reason, \\nincluding termination and maturity, the remaining unamortized difference between the carrying value of the hedged item at that \\ntime and the face value of the hedged item is amortized to earnings over the remaining life of the hedged item, or immediately \\nif the hedged item has matured or has been extinguished. The total notional values of derivatives that were designated and \\nqualified as fair value hedges of this type were $13,693 million and $13,425 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, \\nrespectively.\\n81\\nThe following table summarizes the pretax impact that changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as fair value hedges \\nhad on earnings (in millions):\\nHedging Instruments and Hedged Items\\nFinancial Statement Line Item Impacted\\nGain (Loss)\\nRecognized in \\nIncome\\n2023\\nInterest rate contracts\\nInterest expense\\n$ \\n609 \\nFixed-rate debt\\nInterest expense\\n \\n(591) \\nNet impact of fair value hedging instruments\\n$ \\n18 \\n2022\\nInterest rate contracts\\nInterest expense\\n$ \\n(1,944) \\nFixed-rate debt\\nInterest expense\\n \\n1,927 \\n Net impact of fair value hedging instruments\\n$ \\n(17) \\n2021\\nInterest rate contracts\\nInterest expense\\n$ \\n(67) \\nFixed-rate debt\\nInterest expense\\n \\n66 \\nNet impact of fair value hedging instruments\\n$ \\n(1) \\nThe following table summarizes the amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets related to hedged items in fair value \\nhedging relationships (in millions):\\nCumulative Amount of Fair Value Hedging Adjustments1 \\nCarrying Values of \\nHedged Items\\nIncluded in the Carrying Values \\nof Hedged Items\\nRemaining for Which Hedge \\nAccounting Has Been \\nDiscontinued\\nBalance Sheet Location of Hedged Items\\nDecember 31,\\n2023\\nDecember 31,\\n2022\\nDecember 31,\\n2023\\nDecember 31,\\n2022\\nDecember 31,\\n2023\\nDecember 31,\\n2022\\nCurrent maturities of long-term debt\\n$ \\n552 $ \\n— \\n$ \\n1 $ \\n— \\n$ \\n— $ \\n— \\nLong-term debt\\n \\n12,186  \\n11,900 \\n \\n(1,135)  \\n(1,664)  \\n162  \\n195 \\n1 Cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments does not include changes due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\\nIn June 2023, the Company amended the terms of its interest rate swap agreements to implement a forward-looking interest rate \\nbased on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) in place of the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). Since the \\ninterest rate swap agreements were affected by reference rate reform, the Company applied the expedients and exceptions \\nprovided to preserve the past presentation of its derivatives without de-designating the existing hedging relationships. All \\namendments to interest rate swap agreements were executed with the existing counterparties and did not change the notional \\namounts, maturity dates or other critical terms of the hedging relationships.\\nHedges of Net Investments in Foreign Operations Strategy\\nThe Company uses forward contracts and a portion of its foreign currency denominated debt, a non-derivative financial \\ninstrument, to protect the value of our net investments in a number of foreign operations. For derivative financial instruments \\nthat are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations, the changes in the fair values of the \\nderivative financial instruments are recognized in net foreign currency translation adjustments, a component of AOCI, to offset \\nthe changes in the values of the net investments being hedged. For non-derivative financial instruments that are designated and \\nqualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations, the changes in the carrying values of the designated portions of the \\nnon-derivative financial instruments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are recorded in net foreign currency \\ntranslation adjustments. Any ineffective portions of net investment hedges are reclassified from AOCI into earnings during the \\nperiod of change. \\n82\\nThe following table summarizes the notional values and pretax impact of changes in the fair values of instruments designated as \\nnet investment hedges (in millions):\\nNotional Values\\nGain (Loss) Recognized in OCI\\nas of December 31,\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n \\n2023\\n2022\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nForeign currency contracts\\n$ \\n150 $ \\n— \\n$ \\n(6) $ \\n(10) $ \\n(10) \\nForeign currency denominated debt\\n \\n12,437  \\n12,061 \\n \\n(376)  \\n751  \\n928 \\nTotal\\n$ \\n12,587 $ \\n12,061 \\n$ \\n(382) $ \\n741 $ \\n918 \\nThe Company did not reclassify any gains or losses related to net investment hedges from AOCI into earnings during the years \\nended December 31, 2023 and 2022. The Company reclassified a loss of $4 million related to net investment hedges from \\nAOCI into earnings during the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, the Company did not have any ineffectiveness \\nrelated to net investment hedges during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. The cash inflows and outflows \\nassociated with the Company’s derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges are classified in the line item other \\ninvesting activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows.\\nEconomic (Non-Designated) Hedging Strategy\\nIn addition to derivative instruments that have been designated and qualify for hedge accounting, the Company also uses certain \\nderivatives as economic hedges of foreign currency, interest rate and commodity exposure. Although these derivatives were not \\ndesignated and/or did not qualify for hedge accounting, they are effective economic hedges. The changes in the fair values of \\neconomic hedges are immediately recognized in earnings.\\nThe Company uses foreign currency economic hedges to offset the earnings impact that fluctuations in foreign currency \\nexchange rates have on certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies. The changes in the fair \\nvalues of economic hedges used to offset those monetary assets and liabilities are immediately recognized in earnings in the line \\nitem other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income. In addition, we use foreign currency economic hedges \\nto minimize the variability in cash flows associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including those related \\nto certain acquisition and divestiture activities. The changes in the fair values of economic hedges used to offset the variability \\nin U.S. dollar net cash flows are immediately recognized in earnings in the line items net operating revenues, cost of goods sold \\nor other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income, as applicable. The total notional values of derivatives \\nrelated to our foreign currency economic hedges were $6,989 million and $4,902 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, \\nrespectively.\\nThe Company uses interest rate contracts as economic hedges to minimize exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate \\ndebt that result from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates. There were no interest rate contracts used as economic hedges as \\nof December 31, 2023 and 2022. \\nThe Company also uses certain derivatives as economic hedges to mitigate the price risk associated with the purchase of \\nmaterials used in the manufacturing process and vehicle fuel. The changes in the fair values of these economic hedges are \\nimmediately recognized in earnings in the line items net operating revenues, cost of goods sold, or selling, general and \\nadministrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income, as applicable. The total notional values of derivatives related \\nto our economic hedges of this type were $325 million and $336 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\\n83\\nThe following table presents the pretax impact that changes in the fair values of derivatives not designated as hedging \\ninstruments had on earnings (in millions):\\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Financial Statement Line Item Impacted\\nGain (Loss) Recognized in Income\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nForeign currency contracts\\nNet operating revenues\\n$ \\n(74) $ \\n(55) $ \\n6 \\nForeign currency contracts\\nCost of goods sold\\n \\n66  \\n46  \\n(10) \\nForeign currency contracts\\nOther income (loss) — net\\n \\n(10)  \\n57  \\n(84) \\nCommodity contracts\\nCost of goods sold\\n \\n(137)  \\n(40)  \\n171 \\nInterest rate contracts\\nInterest expense\\n \\n—  \\n—  \\n(187) \\nOther derivative instruments\\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\\n \\n5  \\n(21)  \\n34 \\nOther derivative instruments\\nOther income (loss) — net\\n \\n—  \\n—  \\n(3) \\nTotal\\n $ \\n(150) $ \\n(13) $ \\n(73) \\nNOTE 6: EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS \\nOur consolidated net income includes our Company’s proportionate share of the net income or loss of our equity method \\ninvestees.

Refer to Note 2. \\nNOTE 9: SUPPLY CHAIN FINANCE PROGRAM\\nOur current payment terms with the majority of our suppliers are 120 days. Two global financial institutions offer a voluntary \\nsupply chain finance (“SCF”) program, which enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from the \\nCompany to these financial institutions on a non-recourse basis at a rate that leverages our credit rating and thus may be more \\nbeneficial to them. The SCF program is available to suppliers of goods and services included in cost of goods sold and selling, \\ngeneral and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income. The Company and our suppliers agree on \\ncontractual terms for the goods and services we procure, including prices, quantities and payment terms, regardless of whether \\nthe supplier elects to participate in the SCF program. The suppliers sell goods or services, as applicable, to the Company and \\nissue the associated invoices to the Company based on the agreed-upon contractual terms. Then, if they are participating in the \\nSCF program, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, determine which invoices, if any, they want to sell to the financial \\ninstitutions. Our suppliers’ voluntary inclusion of invoices in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms. No \\nguarantees are provided by the Company or any of our subsidiaries under the SCF program. We have no economic interest in a \\nsupplier’s decision to participate in the SCF program, and we have no direct financial relationship with the financial \\ninstitutions, as it relates to the SCF program. Accordingly, amounts due to our suppliers that elected to participate in the SCF \\nprogram are included in the line item accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet. All activity \\nrelated to amounts due to suppliers that elected to participate in the SCF program is reflected within the operating activities \\nsection of our consolidated statement of cash flows. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the amount of obligations outstanding \\nthat the Company has confirmed as valid to the financial institutions under the SCF program was $1,421 million and \\n$1,351 million, respectively.\\nNOTE 10: LEASES \\nWe have operating leases primarily for real estate, manufacturing and other equipment, aircraft and vehicles. \\nBalance sheet information related to operating leases is as follows (in millions):\\nDecember 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\nOperating lease ROU assets1\\n$ \\n1,328 $ \\n1,406 \\nCurrent portion of operating lease liabilities2\\n$ \\n361 $ \\n341 \\nNoncurrent portion of operating lease liabilities3\\n \\n1,001  \\n1,113 \\nTotal operating lease liabilities\\n$ \\n1,362 $ \\n1,454 \\n1 Operating lease ROU assets are included in the line item other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\\n2 The current portion of operating lease liabilities is included in the line item accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated \\nbalance sheets.\\n3 The noncurrent portion of operating lease liabilities is included in the line item other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.\\nWe had operating lease costs of $397 million for both the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.

As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, \\nwe had $4,209 million and $2,146 million, respectively, in outstanding commercial paper borrowings. Our weighted-average \\ninterest rates for commercial paper outstanding were 5.3% and 4.2% as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of \\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company also had $348 million and $227 million, respectively, in lines of credit, short-term \\ncredit facilities and other short-term borrowings that were related to our international operations.\\nIn addition, we had $6,159 million in unused lines of credit and other short-term credit facilities as of December 31, 2023, of \\nwhich $4,550 million was in corporate backup lines of credit for general purposes. These backup lines of credit expire at \\nvarious times through 2028. There were no borrowings under these corporate backup lines of credit during 2023. These credit \\nfacilities are subject to normal banking terms and conditions.

Refer to Note 5 for additional information about \\nour fair value hedging strategy.\\n4 As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the fair value of our long-term debt, including the current portion, was $33,445 million and \\n$32,698 million, respectively. \\n5 The above notes and debentures include various restrictions, none of which was significant to our Company.\\nTotal interest paid was $1,415 million, $848 million and $738 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\\nDuring 2021, the Company extinguished prior to maturity fixed interest rate U.S. dollar notes and euro notes of $6,500 million \\nand €2,430 million, respectively, with maturity dates ranging from 2023 to 2026 and interest rates ranging from 0.750% to \\n3.200%. These extinguishments resulted in associated charges of $559 million recorded in the line item interest expense in our \\nconsolidated statement of income. These charges included the difference between the reacquisition price and the net carrying \\nvalue of the notes extinguished, including the impact of the related fair value hedging relationships. We also incurred charges of \\n$91 million as a result of the reclassification of related cash flow hedging balances from AOCI into income.\\nThe following table summarizes the maturities of long-term debt for the five years succeeding December 31, 2023 (in millions):\\nMaturities of\\nLong-Term Debt\\n2024\\n$ \\n1,960 \\n2025\\n \\n1,070 \\n2026\\n \\n1,810 \\n2027\\n \\n4,616 \\n2028\\n \\n2,770 \\nNOTE 12: COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES \\nGuarantees\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we were contingently liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third parties of $633 million, of \\nwhich $87 million was related to VIEs. Refer to Note 1 for additional information related to the Company’s maximum exposure \\nto loss due to our involvement with VIEs. Our guarantees are primarily related to third-party customers, bottlers and vendors \\nand arose through the normal course of business. These guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees is \\nindividually significant. These amounts represent the maximum potential future payments that we could be required to make \\nunder the guarantees. However, management has concluded that the likelihood of any significant amounts being paid by our \\nCompany under these guarantees is not probable.\\n89\\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\\nWe believe our exposure to concentrations of credit risk is limited due to the diverse geographic areas covered by our \\noperations.\\nLegal Contingencies\\nThe Company is involved in various legal proceedings. We establish reserves for specific legal proceedings when we determine \\nthat the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Management has \\nalso identified certain other legal matters where we believe an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and/or for which no \\nestimate of possible losses can be made. Management believes that the total liabilities of the Company that may arise as a result \\nof currently pending legal proceedings (excluding tax audit claims) will not have a material adverse effect on the Company \\ntaken as a whole.\\nIndemnifications\\nAt the time we acquire or divest an ownership interest in an entity, we sometimes agree to indemnify the seller or buyer for \\nspecific contingent liabilities. Management believes that any liability to the Company that may arise as a result of any such \\nindemnification agreements will not have a material adverse effect on the Company taken as a whole.\\nTax Audits\\nThe Company is involved in various tax matters, with respect to some of which the outcome is uncertain. These uncertain tax \\nmatters may result in the assessment of additional taxes. Refer to Note 15.\\nOn September 17, 2015, the Company received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (“Notice”) from the United States Internal \\nRevenue Service (“IRS”) seeking approximately $3.3 billion of additional federal income tax for years 2007 through 2009. In \\nthe Notice, the IRS stated its intent to reallocate over $9 billion of income to the U.S. parent company from certain of its \\nforeign affiliates that the U.S. parent company licensed to manufacture, distribute, sell, market and promote its products in \\ncertain non-U.S. markets. \\nThe Notice concerned the Company’s transfer pricing between its U.S. parent company and certain of its foreign affiliates. IRS \\nrules governing transfer pricing require arm’s-length pricing of transactions between related parties such as the Company’s U.S. \\nparent and its foreign affiliates. \\nTo resolve the same transfer pricing issue for the tax years 1987 through 1995, the Company and the IRS had agreed in 1996 on \\nan arm’s-length methodology for determining the amount of U.S. taxable income that the U.S. parent company would report as \\ncompensation from its foreign licensees. The Company and the IRS memorialized this accord in a closing agreement resolving \\nthat dispute (“Closing Agreement”). The Closing Agreement provided that, absent a change in material facts or circumstances \\nor relevant federal tax law, in calculating the Company’s income taxes going forward, the Company would not be assessed \\npenalties by the IRS for using the agreed-upon tax calculation methodology that the Company and the IRS agreed would be \\nused for the 1987 through 1995 tax years. \\nThe IRS audited and confirmed the Company’s compliance with the agreed-upon Closing Agreement methodology in five \\nsuccessive audit cycles for tax years 1996 through 2006. \\nThe September 17, 2015 Notice from the IRS retroactively rejected the previously agreed-upon methodology for the 2007 \\nthrough 2009 tax years in favor of an entirely different methodology, without prior notice to the Company. Using the new tax \\ncalculation methodology, the IRS reallocated over $9 billion of income to the U.S. parent company from its foreign licensees \\nfor tax years 2007 through 2009. Consistent with the Closing Agreement, the IRS did not assert penalties, and it has yet           \\nto do so. \\nThe IRS designated the Company’s matter for litigation on October 15, 2015. Litigation designation is an IRS determination \\nthat forecloses to a company any and all alternative means for resolution of a tax dispute. As a result of the IRS’ designation of \\nthe Company’s matter for litigation, the Company was forced to either accept the IRS’ newly imposed tax assessment and pay \\nthe full amount of the asserted tax or litigate the matter in the federal courts. The matter remains subject to the IRS’ litigation \\ndesignation, preventing the Company from any attempt to settle or otherwise mutually resolve the matter with the IRS.\\nThe Company consequently initiated litigation by filing a petition in the U.S. Tax Court (“Tax Court”) in December 2015, \\nchallenging the tax adjustments enumerated in the Notice. \\nPrior to trial, the IRS increased its transfer pricing adjustment by $385 million, resulting in an additional tax adjustment of \\n$135 million. The Company obtained a summary judgment in its favor on a different matter related to Mexican foreign tax \\ncredits, which thereafter effectively reduced the IRS’ potential tax adjustment by $138 million.\\n90\\nThe trial was held in the Tax Court from March through May 2018, and final post-trial briefs were filed and exchanged in   \\nApril 2019.\\nOn November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued an opinion (“Opinion”) in which it predominantly sided with the IRS but agreed \\nwith the Company that dividends previously paid by the foreign licensees to the U.S. parent company in reliance upon the \\nClosing Agreement should continue to be allowed to offset royalties, including those that would become payable to the \\nCompany in accordance with the Opinion. On November 8, 2023, the Tax Court issued a supplemental opinion (together with \\nthe original Tax Court opinion, “Opinions”), siding with the IRS in concluding both that the blocked-income regulations apply \\nto the Company’s operations and that the Tax Court opinion in 3M Co. & Subs. v. Commissioner (February 9, 2023) controlled \\nas to the validity of those regulations.\\nThe Company believes that the IRS and the Tax Court misinterpreted and misapplied the applicable regulations in reallocating \\nincome earned by the Company’s foreign licensees to increase the Company’s U.S. tax. Moreover, the Company believes that \\nthe retroactive imposition of such tax liability using a calculation methodology different from that previously agreed upon by \\nthe IRS and the Company, and audited by the IRS for over a decade, is unconstitutional. The Company intends to assert its \\nclaims on appeal and vigorously defend its position.\\nIn determining the amount of tax reserve to be recorded as of December 31, 2020, the Company completed the required two-\\nstep evaluation process prescribed by Accounting Standards Codification 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. In doing so, we \\nconsulted with outside advisors, and we reviewed and considered relevant laws, rules, and regulations, including, but not \\nlimited to, the Opinions and relevant caselaw. We also considered our intention to vigorously defend our positions and assert \\nour various well-founded legal claims via every available avenue of appeal. We concluded, based on the technical and legal \\nmerits of the Company’s tax positions, that it is more likely than not the Company’s tax positions will ultimately be sustained \\non appeal. In addition, we considered a number of alternative transfer pricing methodologies, including the methodology \\nasserted by the IRS and affirmed in the Opinions (“Tax Court Methodology”), that could be applied by the courts upon final \\nresolution of the litigation. Based on the required probability analysis, we determined the methodologies we believe the federal \\ncourts could ultimately order to be used in calculating the Company’s tax. As a result of this analysis, we recorded a tax reserve \\nof $438 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the application of the resulting methodologies as well as \\nthe different tax treatment applicable to dividends originally paid to the U.S. parent company by its foreign licensees, in \\nreliance upon the Closing Agreement, that would be recharacterized as royalties in accordance with the Opinions and the \\nCompany’s analysis. \\nThe Company’s conclusion that it is more likely than not the Company’s tax positions will ultimately be sustained on appeal is \\nunchanged as of December 31, 2023. However, we updated our calculation of the methodologies we believe the federal courts \\ncould ultimately order to be used in calculating the Company’s tax. As a result of the application of the required probability \\nanalysis to these updated calculations and the accrual of interest through the current reporting period, we updated our tax \\nreserve as of December 31, 2023 to $439 million.\\nWhile the Company strongly disagrees with the IRS’ positions and the portions of the Opinions affirming such positions, it is \\npossible that some portion or all of the adjustment proposed by the IRS and sustained by the Tax Court could ultimately be \\nupheld. In that event, the Company would likely be subject to significant additional liabilities for tax years 2007 through 2009, \\nand potentially also for subsequent years, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position, \\nresults of operations and cash flows.\\nThe Company calculated the potential impact of applying the Tax Court Methodology to reallocate income from foreign \\nlicensees potentially covered within the scope of the Opinions, assuming such methodology were to be ultimately upheld by the \\ncourts, and the IRS were to decide to apply that methodology to subsequent years, with consent of the federal courts. This \\nimpact would include taxes and interest accrued through December 31, 2023 for the 2007 through 2009 litigated tax years and \\nfor subsequent tax years from 2010 through 2023. The calculations incorporated the estimated impact of correlative adjustments \\nto the previously accrued transition tax payable under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform Act”). The Company \\nestimates that the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability could be approximately $16 billion as of \\nDecember 31, 2023. Additional income tax and interest would continue to accrue until the time any such potential liability, or \\nportion thereof, were to be paid. We currently project the continued application of the Tax Court Methodology in future years, \\nassuming similar facts and circumstances as of December 31, 2023, would result in an incremental annual tax liability that \\nwould increase the Company’s effective tax rate by approximately 3.5%. \\nThe Company and the IRS are now in the process of agreeing on the tax impacts of the Opinions. Subsequent to the completion \\nof this process, the Tax Court will render a decision in the case. The Company will have 90 days thereafter to file a notice of \\nappeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. The IRS will then seek to collect, and the Company expects to \\npay, any additional tax related to the 2007 through 2009 tax years reflected in the Tax Court decision (and interest thereon). The \\nCompany currently estimates that the payment to be made at that time related to the 2007 through 2009 tax years, which is \\n91\\nincluded in the above estimate of the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability, would be approximately \\n$5.8 billion (including interest accrued through December 31, 2023), plus any additional interest accrued through the time of \\npayment. Some or all of this amount, plus accrued interest, would be refunded if the Company were to prevail on appeal. \\nRisk Management Programs\\nThe Company has numerous global insurance programs in place to help protect the Company from the risk of loss. In general, \\nwe are self-insured for large portions of many different types of claims; however, we do use commercial insurance above our \\nself-insured retentions to reduce the Company’s risk of catastrophic loss. Our reserves for the Company’s self-insured losses are \\nestimated using actuarial methods and assumptions of the insurance industry, adjusted for our specific expectations based on \\nour claims history. Our self-insurance reserves totaled $197 million and $199 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, \\nrespectively.\\nNOTE 13: STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS \\nOur Company grants long-term equity awards under its stock-based compensation plans to certain employees of the Company. \\nThe Coca-Cola Company 2014 Equity Plan (“2014 Equity Plan”) was approved by shareowners in April 2014. Under the 2014 \\nEquity Plan, a maximum of 500 million shares of our common stock was approved to be issued through the grant of equity \\nawards. The 2014 Equity Plan allows for grants of stock options, performance share units, restricted stock, restricted stock units \\nand other specified award types, including cash awards with performance-based vesting criteria. As of December 31, 2023, \\nthere were 284 million shares available to be granted under the 2014 Equity Plan. In addition, there were 3 million shares \\navailable for stock option and restricted stock award grants under plans approved by shareowners prior to 2014.\\nTotal stock-based compensation expense was $251 million, $361 million and $337 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, \\nrespectively. In 2022, for certain employees who accepted voluntary separation from the Company as a result of the \\nrestructuring of our North America operating unit, the Company provided cash payments designed to offset the loss of certain \\nequity awards and serve as a cash supplement to the employees upon the exercise of certain stock options. The stock-based \\ncompensation expense in 2022 arising from the estimated cash payments was $5 million and was recorded in the line item other \\noperating charges, and the remaining stock-based compensation expense of $356 million was recorded in the line item selling, \\ngeneral and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income. In 2023, the Company recorded stock-based \\ncompensation expense of $254 million in the line item selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated \\nstatement of income. This was partially offset by $3 million related to the revision of management’s estimates arising from the \\nsettlement of the estimated cash payments recognized in 2022, which was recorded in the line item other operating charges in \\nour consolidated statement of income. Refer to Note 19 for additional information on the Company’s restructuring and strategic \\nrealignment initiatives. All stock-based compensation expense in 2021 was recorded in the line item selling, general and \\nadministrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income. The total income tax benefit recognized in our consolidated \\nstatements of income related to total stock-based compensation expense was $40 million, $55 million and $60 million in 2023, \\n2022 and 2021, respectively. \\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $267 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock-based \\ncompensation awards granted under our plans, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years as \\nstock-based compensation expense. This expected cost does not include the impact of any future stock-based compensation \\nawards.\\n92\\nStock Option Awards\\nStock option awards are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the average of the high and low market prices per \\nshare of the Company’s stock on the grant date. The fair value of each stock option award is estimated using a Black-Scholes-\\nMerton option-pricing model and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is generally four years. \\nThe weighted-average fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 and the \\nweighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model for such grants were as follows:\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nFair value of stock options on grant date\\n$ \\n9.84 \\n$ \\n8.23 \\n$ \\n5.08 \\nDividend yield1\\n 3.0% \\n 2.8% \\n 3.3% \\nExpected volatility2\\n 17.5% \\n 18.0% \\n 18.0% \\nRisk-free interest rate3\\n 4.1% \\n 1.9% \\n 0.9% \\nExpected term of stock options4\\n6 years\\n6 years\\n6 years\\n1 The dividend yield is the calculated yield on the closing market price per share of the Company’s stock on the grant date.\\n2 The expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on the Company’s stock, historical volatility of the Company’s \\nstock and other factors.\\n3 The risk-free interest rate for the period matching the expected term of the stock options is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect \\non the grant date.\\n4 The expected term of the stock options represents the period of time that stock options are expected to be outstanding and is derived by \\nanalyzing historical exercise behavior.\\nStock option awards generally expire 10 years after the grant date. The shares of common stock to be issued and/or sold upon \\nthe exercise of stock options are made available from either authorized and unissued common stock or from treasury shares. \\nSince 2007, the Company has issued common stock under its stock-based compensation plans from treasury shares.\\nStock option activity during the year ended December 31, 2023 was as follows:\\nShares\\n(In millions)\\nWeighted-\\nAverage\\nExercise Price\\nWeighted-\\nAverage\\nRemaining\\nContractual Term\\nAggregate\\nIntrinsic Value\\n(In millions)\\nOutstanding on January 1, 2023\\n \\n59 $ \\n45.93 \\n \\n \\nGranted\\n \\n3  \\n60.05 \\n \\n \\nExercised\\n \\n(14)  \\n39.47 \\n \\n \\nForfeited/expired\\n \\n(1)  \\n55.58 \\n \\n \\nOutstanding on December 31, 2023\\n \\n47 $ \\n48.52 \\n4.7 years $ \\n507 \\nExpected to vest\\n \\n46 $ \\n48.38 \\n4.6 years $ \\n506 \\nExercisable on December 31, 2023\\n \\n36 $ \\n45.55 \\n3.7 years $ \\n483 \\nThe total intrinsic value of the stock options exercised was $268 million, $534 million and $358 million in 2023, 2022 and \\n2021, respectively. The total number of stock options exercised was 14 million, 22 million and 19 million in 2023, 2022 and \\n2021, respectively.\\nPerformance-Based Share Unit Awards\\nPerformance share unit awards require achievement of certain performance criteria, which are predefined by the Talent and \\nCompensation Committee of our Board of Directors at the time of grant. For performance share unit awards granted from 2018 \\nthrough 2022, the performance criteria were equally weighted among net operating revenues, earnings per share and free cash \\nflow over a predefined performance period of three years. For performance share unit awards granted to executives in 2022, and \\nfor performance share unit awards granted to all participants in 2023, the performance criteria were weighted 30% for net \\noperating revenues, 30% for earnings per share, 30% for free cash flow and 10% for environmental sustainability. For purposes \\nof these performance criteria, earnings per share is diluted net income per share; free cash flow is net cash provided by \\noperating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment; and environmental sustainability is comprised of \\npredefined goals related to the Company’s packaging and water security strategies. These performance criteria are adjusted for \\ncertain items, if applicable, which are subject to Audit Committee approval. The purpose of these adjustments is to ensure a \\nconsistent year-to-year comparison of the specific performance criteria. Performance share unit awards granted to executives in \\n2018 through 2022 and performance share unit awards granted to all participants in 2023 include a relative TSR modifier to \\ndetermine the final number of performance share units earned. The fair value of performance share units that include a TSR \\n93\\nmodifier is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model. For these awards, the number of performance share units earned \\nbased on the certified achievement of the predefined performance criteria will be reduced or increased if the Company’s total \\nshareowner return over the performance period relative to a predefined group of companies falls outside of a predefined range. \\nThe fair value of performance share units that do not include a TSR modifier is the closing market price per share of the \\nCompany’s stock on the grant date less the present value of the expected dividends not received during the performance period. \\nThe performance share unit awards will generally vest at the end of the respective performance period. \\nDuring 2021, in addition to granting performance share unit awards with a three-year performance period, the Company granted \\nemerging stronger performance share unit awards with a predefined performance period of two years. The award’s performance \\ncriterion was earnings per share, and the award included a relative TSR modifier. Earnings per share for these purposes was \\ndiluted net income per share adjusted for certain items, which were approved by the Audit Committee. The purpose of these \\nadjustments was to ensure a consistent year-to-year comparison of the performance criterion. These performance share unit \\nawards generally vested at the end of the two-year performance period.\\nFor performance share unit awards, in the event the certified results equal the predefined performance criteria, the number of \\nperformance share units earned will be equal to the target award. In the event the certified results exceed the predefined \\nperformance criteria, additional performance share units up to the maximum award will be earned. In the event the certified \\nresults fall below the predefined performance criteria but are at or above the minimum threshold, a reduced number of \\nperformance share units will be earned. If the certified results fall below the minimum threshold, no performance share units \\nwill be earned. Performance share unit awards do not entitle participants to vote or receive dividends until the performance \\nshare units are settled in stock. \\nIn the reporting period it becomes probable that the minimum performance threshold specified in the performance share unit \\naward will be achieved, we recognize compensation expense for the proportionate share of the total fair value of the \\nperformance share units related to the vesting period that has already lapsed for the performance share units expected to vest. \\nThe remaining fair value of the performance share units expected to vest is expensed on a straight-line basis over the remainder \\nof the vesting period. In the event the Company determines it is no longer probable that the minimum performance threshold \\nspecified in the award will be achieved, we reverse all previously recognized compensation expense in the reporting period such \\na determination is made.\\nPerformance share units earned are generally settled in stock, except for certain circumstances such as death or disability, in \\nwhich case beneficiaries or employees are provided cash payments. As of December 31, 2023, nonvested performance share \\nunits of approximately 1,567,000 and 1,287,000 were outstanding for the 2022-2024 and 2023-2025 performance periods, \\nrespectively, based on the target award amounts. \\nThe following table summarizes information about outstanding nonvested performance share units based on the target award \\nlevels:\\nPerformance \\nShare Units\\n(In thousands)\\nWeighted-\\nAverage\\nGrant Date\\nFair Value\\nNonvested on January 1, 2023\\n \\n3,706 $ \\n52.94 \\nGranted\\n \\n1,323  \\n56.63 \\nVested1\\n \\n(1,831)  \\n46.65 \\nForfeited\\n \\n(344)  \\n54.65 \\nNonvested on December 31, 20232\\n \\n2,854 $ \\n58.48 \\n1 Represents the target level of performance share units vested as of December 31, 2023 for the 2021-2023 performance period.

Our Company also sponsors postretirement health care and life insurance \\nbenefit plans covering certain U.S. employees. In addition, our Company and its subsidiaries have various pension plans and \\nother forms of postretirement benefit arrangements outside the United States. \\nAs of December 31, 2023, the U.S. qualified pension plan represented 63% and 56% of the Company’s consolidated projected \\nbenefit obligation and pension plan assets, respectively.\\n95\\nObligations and Funded Status\\nThe following table sets forth the changes in the benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension and other \\npostretirement benefit plans (in millions):\\nPension Plans\\nOther Postretirement Benefit Plans\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2023\\n2022\\nBenefit obligation at beginning of year1\\n$ \\n6,376 \\n$ \\n8,580 \\n$ \\n495 \\n$ \\n696 \\nService cost\\n \\n94 \\n \\n93 \\n \\n4 \\n \\n7 \\nInterest cost\\n \\n322 \\n \\n232 \\n \\n27 \\n \\n17 \\nParticipant contributions\\n \\n5 \\n \\n5 \\n \\n9 \\n \\n11 \\nForeign currency exchange rate changes\\n \\n27 \\n \\n(152)  \\n(4)  \\n(4) \\nAmendments\\n \\n— \\n \\n9 \\n \\n1 \\n \\n— \\nNet actuarial loss (gain)2\\n \\n375 \\n \\n(1,891)  \\n14 \\n \\n(175) \\nBenefits paid\\n \\n(369)  \\n(500)  \\n(62)  \\n(57) \\nDivestitures\\n \\n— \\n \\n(2)  \\n— \\n \\n— \\nSettlements\\n \\n(287) 3  \\n(26)  \\n(187) 4  \\n— \\nCurtailments\\n \\n— \\n \\n(1)  \\n— \\n \\n— \\nSpecial termination benefits\\n \\n1 \\n \\n1 \\n \\n— \\n \\n— \\nOther\\n \\n— \\n \\n28 \\n \\n— \\n \\n— \\nBenefit obligation at end of year1\\n$ \\n6,544 \\n$ \\n6,376 \\n$ \\n297 \\n$ \\n495 \\nFair value of plan assets at beginning of year\\n$ \\n7,158 \\n$ \\n8,905 \\n$ \\n373 \\n$ \\n419 \\nActual return on plan assets\\n \\n537 \\n \\n(1,101)  \\n17 \\n \\n(55) \\nEmployer contributions\\n \\n44 \\n \\n33 \\n \\n— \\n \\n— \\nParticipant contributions\\n \\n5 \\n \\n5 \\n \\n7 \\n \\n9 \\nForeign currency exchange rate changes\\n \\n76 \\n \\n(258)  \\n— \\n \\n— \\nBenefits paid\\n \\n(300)  \\n(427)  \\n(34)  \\n— \\nSettlements\\n \\n(260) 3  \\n(26)  \\n(187) 4  \\n— \\nOther\\n \\n— \\n \\n27 \\n \\n— \\n \\n— \\nFair value of plan assets at end of year\\n$ \\n7,260 \\n$ \\n7,158 \\n$ \\n176 \\n$ \\n373 \\nNet asset (liability) recognized\\n$ \\n716 \\n$ \\n782 \\n$ \\n(121) $ \\n(122) \\n1 For pension plans, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation. For other postretirement benefit plans, the benefit obligation is \\nthe accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. The accumulated benefit obligation for our pension plans was $6,463 million and \\n$6,307 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\\n2 A change in the weighted-average discount rate assumption was the primary driver of net actuarial loss (gain) during 2023 and 2022. For our \\nU.S. qualified pension plan, a decrease in the discount rate resulted in an actuarial loss of $129 million during 2023, and an increase in the \\ndiscount rate resulted in an actuarial gain of $1,231 million during 2022. Additional drivers of net actuarial loss (gain) included other \\nassumption updates and plan experience. \\n3 Settlements primarily related to the U.S. qualified pension plan, which was amended in 2023 to provide lump sum payment options to all \\nformer employees. The U.S. qualified pension plan made $259 million of lump sum payments in 2023, causing a plan settlement, which \\nresulted in recognition of a $76 million settlement charge related to the acceleration of existing unrecognized losses. \\n4 In 2023, the Company settled its U.S. post-65 other postretirement benefit obligations such that retiree reimbursement accounts will be \\nfunded by an insurance company beginning January 1, 2025 for the lifetime of certain retirees and their eligible dependents. The transaction \\nresulted in no change to underlying benefits or plan administration, but only to the future financing of the benefits. Pursuant to the \\nsettlement, the Company transferred $187 million of plan assets and liabilities to an insurer and recognized a $14 million net settlement \\ncredit related to the acceleration of existing unrecognized gains.\\n96\\nPension and other postretirement benefit plan amounts recognized in our consolidated balance sheets were as follows (in \\nmillions):\\nPension Plans\\nOther Postretirement Benefit Plans\\nDecember 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2023\\n2022\\nOther noncurrent assets\\n$ \\n1,543 $ \\n1,558 \\n$ \\n— $ \\n44 \\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\\n \\n(67)  \\n(70)  \\n(4)  \\n(17) \\nOther noncurrent liabilities\\n \\n(760)  \\n(706)  \\n(117)  \\n(149) \\nNet asset (liability) recognized\\n$ \\n716 $ \\n782 \\n$ \\n(121) $ \\n(122) \\nCertain of our pension plans have a projected benefit obligation in excess of the fair value of plan assets.

There are \\na significant number of mutual, pooled and commingled funds from which investors can choose. The selection of the type of fund is dictated \\nby the specific investment objectives and needs of a given plan. These objectives and needs vary greatly between plans.\\n2 Fair value disclosures related to our pension plan assets are included in Note 17. Fair value disclosures include, but are not limited to, the \\nlevels within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements in their entirety fall; a reconciliation of the beginning and ending \\nbalances of Level 3 assets; and information about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure the fair value of our pension plan \\nassets.\\nInvestment Strategy for U.S. Pension Plan\\nThe Company utilizes the services of investment managers to actively manage the assets of our U.S. qualified pension plan. We \\nhave established asset allocation targets and investment guidelines with each investment manager. Our asset allocation targets \\npromote optimal expected return and volatility characteristics given the long-term time horizon for fulfilling the obligations of \\nthe plan. Selection of the targeted asset allocation for U.S. pension plan assets is based upon a review of the expected return and \\nrisk characteristics of each asset class, as well as the correlation of returns among asset classes. Our target allocation is a mix of \\n18% equity securities, 47% fixed-income securities and 35% alternative investments. We believe this target allocation will \\nenable us to achieve the following long-term investment objectives:\\n(1) optimize the long-term return on plan assets at an acceptable level of risk;\\n(2) maintain a broad diversification across asset classes and among investment managers; and\\n(3) maintain careful control of the risk level within each asset class.\\nThe investment guidelines that have been established with each investment manager provide parameters within which the \\ninvestment managers agree to operate, including criteria that determine eligible and ineligible securities, diversification \\nrequirements and credit quality standards, where applicable. Investment managers agree to obtain written approval for \\ndeviations from stated investment style or guidelines. As of December 31, 2023, no investment manager was responsible for \\nmore than 28% of total U.S. pension plan assets.\\nOur target allocation of 18% equity securities is composed of 81% global equities, 11% emerging market equities and 8% \\ndomestic small-cap and mid-cap equities. Optimal returns through our investments in global equities are achieved through \\nsecurity selection as well as country and sector diversification. As of December 31, 2023, investments in our common stock \\naccounted for 9% of total global equities and 5% of total U.S. pension plan assets. Our investments in global equities are \\nintended to provide diversified exposure to both U.S. and non-U.S. equity markets. Our investments in both emerging market \\nequities and domestic small-cap and mid-cap equities may experience large swings in their market value. Our investments in \\nthese asset classes are selected based on capital appreciation potential.\\nOur target allocation of 47% fixed-income securities is composed of 62% long-duration bonds and 38% with multi-strategy \\nalternative credit managers. Long-duration bonds are intended to provide a stable rate of return through investments in high-\\nquality publicly traded debt securities. Our investments in long-duration bonds are diversified in order to mitigate duration and \\n98\\ncredit exposure. Multi-strategy alternative credit managers invest in a combination of high-yield bonds, bank loans, structured \\ncredit and emerging market debt. These investments are in lower-rated and non-rated debt securities, which generally produce \\nhigher returns compared to long-duration bonds and also help diversify our overall fixed-income portfolio.\\nOur target allocation for alternative investments is 35%. These alternative investments include hedge funds, reinsurance, private \\nequity limited partnerships, leveraged buyout funds, international venture capital partnerships and real estate. The objective of \\ninvesting in alternative investments is to provide a higher rate of return than that which is typically available from publicly \\ntraded equity securities. Alternative investments are inherently illiquid and require a long-term perspective in evaluating \\ninvestment performance.\\nInvestment Strategy for Non-U.S. Pension Plans\\nThe long-term target allocation for 66% of our international subsidiaries’ pension plan assets, primarily certain of our European \\nand Canadian plans, is 60% equity securities, 29% fixed-income securities and 11% other investments. The actual allocation for \\nthe remaining 34% of the Company’s international subsidiaries’ pension plan assets consisted of 40% mutual, pooled and \\ncommingled funds; 23% fixed-income securities; 2% equity securities; and 35% other investments as of December 31, 2023. \\nThe investment strategies for our international subsidiaries’ pension plans vary greatly, and in some instances are influenced by \\nlocal law. None of our pension plans outside the United States is individually significant for separate disclosure.\\nOther Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets\\nPlan assets associated with other postretirement benefits primarily represent funding of one of the U.S. postretirement health \\ncare benefit plans through a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association (“VEBA”), a tax-qualified trust. The VEBA assets \\nare primarily invested in liquid assets due to the level and timing of expected future benefit payments.\\nThe following table presents total assets by asset class for our other postretirement benefit plans (in millions):\\nDecember 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\nCash and cash equivalents\\n$ \\n10 $ \\n43 \\nEquity securities:\\nU.S.-based companies\\n \\n73  \\n133 \\nInternational-based companies\\n \\n4  \\n4 \\nFixed-income securities:\\nGovernment bonds\\n \\n14  \\n12 \\nCorporate bonds and debt securities\\n \\n7  \\n71 \\nMutual, pooled and commingled funds\\n \\n39  \\n86 \\nHedge funds/limited partnerships\\n \\n18  \\n14 \\nReal estate\\n \\n6  \\n6 \\nOther\\n \\n5  \\n4 \\nTotal other postretirement benefit plan assets1\\n$ \\n176 $ \\n373 \\n1 Fair value disclosures related to our other postretirement benefit plan assets are included in Note 17.

The gain/loss corridor is equal to 10% of the greater of the benefit \\nobligation and the market-related value of assets. Gains and losses in excess of the corridor are generally amortized over the average future \\nworking lifetime of the plan participants. \\n3 Settlements primarily related to the U.S. qualified pension plan, which was amended in 2023 to provide lump sum payment options to all \\nformer employees. The U.S. qualified pension plan made $259 million of lump sum payments in 2023, causing a plan settlement, which \\nresulted in recognition of a $76 million settlement charge related to the acceleration of existing unrecognized losses.\\n4 Settlement charges were primarily related to our strategic realignment initiatives. Refer to Note 19.\\n5 In 2023, the Company settled its U.S. post-65 other postretirement benefit obligations such that retiree reimbursement accounts will be \\nfunded by an insurance company beginning January 1, 2025 for the lifetime of certain retirees and their eligible dependents. The transaction \\nresulted in no change to underlying benefits or plan administration, but only to the future financing of the benefits. Pursuant to the \\nsettlement, the Company transferred $187 million of plan assets and liabilities to an insurer and recognized a $14 million net settlement \\ncredit related to the acceleration of existing unrecognized gains.\\nAll of the amounts in the table above, other than service cost, were recorded in the line item other income (loss) — net in our \\nconsolidated statements of income.\\nImpact on Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\\nThe following table sets forth the pretax changes in AOCI for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans (in millions):\\nPension Plans\\nOther Postretirement Benefit Plans\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2023\\n2022\\nBalance in AOCI at beginning of year\\n$ \\n(1,755) $ \\n(2,125) $ \\n95 $ \\n(4) \\nRecognized prior service cost (credit)\\n \\n1  \\n— \\n \\n(3)  \\n(3) \\nRecognized net actuarial loss (gain)\\n \\n177  \\n107 \\n \\n(19)  \\n— \\nPrior service cost occurring during the year\\n \\n—  \\n(9)  \\n(1)  \\n— \\nNet actuarial gain (loss) occurring during the year\\n \\n(313)  \\n232 \\n \\n(12)  \\n104 \\nNet foreign currency translation adjustments\\n \\n(16)  \\n40 \\n \\n1  \\n(2) \\nBalance in AOCI at end of year\\n$ \\n(1,906) $ \\n(1,755) $ \\n61 $ \\n95 \\n100\\nThe following table sets forth the pretax amounts in AOCI for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans (in millions):\\nPension Plans\\nOther Postretirement Benefit Plans\\nDecember 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2023\\n2022\\nPrior service credit (cost)\\n$ \\n(17) $ \\n(17) $ \\n20 $ \\n24 \\nNet actuarial gain (loss)\\n \\n(1,889)  \\n(1,738)  \\n41  \\n71 \\nBalance in AOCI at end of year\\n$ \\n(1,906) $ \\n(1,755) $ \\n61 $ \\n95 \\nAssumptions\\nCertain weighted-average assumptions used in computing the benefit obligations for our pension and other postretirement \\nbenefit plans were as follows:\\nPension Plans\\nOther Postretirement Benefit Plans\\nDecember 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2023\\n2022\\nDiscount rate\\n 5.00% \\n 5.50% \\n 6.25% \\n 6.00% \\nInterest crediting rate\\n 3.75% \\n 4.00% \\nN/A\\nN/A\\nRate of increase in compensation levels\\n 4.00% \\n 3.75% \\nN/A\\nN/A\\nCertain weighted-average assumptions used in computing net periodic benefit cost or income were as follows:\\nPension Plans\\nOther Postretirement Benefit Plans\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nDiscount rate\\n 5.50% \\n 3.00% \\n 2.50% \\n 6.00% \\n 3.25% \\n 2.75% \\nInterest crediting rate\\n 4.00% \\n 3.00% \\n 3.00% \\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nRate of increase in compensation levels\\n 3.75% \\n 3.75% \\n 3.75% \\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nExpected long-term rate of return on plan assets\\n 6.75% \\n 7.00% \\n 7.25% \\n 3.75% \\n 4.00% \\n 4.25% \\nThe discount rate assumption used to account for pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflects the rate at which the \\nbenefit obligations could be effectively settled. The discount rate for U.S. and certain non-U.S. plans is determined using a \\nmatching technique whereby the rates of a yield curve, developed from high-quality debt securities, are applied to projected \\nbenefit cash flows to determine the appropriate effective discount rate. For other non-U.S. plans, we base the discount rate \\nassumption on comparable indices within each of the countries. The Company measures the service cost and interest cost \\ncomponents of net periodic benefit cost or income for pension and other postretirement benefit plans by applying the specific \\nspot rates along the yield curve to the plans’ projected benefit cash flows. The rate of compensation increase assumption is \\ndetermined by the Company based upon annual reviews.\\n101\\nThe cash balance interest crediting rate for the U.S. qualified pension plan is based on the yield on six-month U.S. Treasury \\nbills on the last day of September of the previous plan year, plus 150 basis points, with a minimum interest crediting rate of \\n3.80% for all active employees and certain former employees. The Company assumes that the ultimate interest crediting rate is \\n140 basis points lower than the plan’s year-end discount rate and that the current interest crediting rate will converge with the \\nultimate interest crediting rate after a period of 10 years.\\nThe expected long-term rate of return assumption for U.S. pension plan assets is based upon the target asset allocation and is \\ndetermined using forward-looking assumptions in the context of historical returns and volatilities for each asset class, as well as \\ncorrelations among asset classes. We evaluate the expected long-term rate of return assumption on an annual basis. The \\nexpected long-term rate of return assumption used in computing 2023 net periodic benefit income for the U.S. pension plans \\nwas 6.75%. As of December 31, 2023, the 5-year, 10-year and 15-year annualized return for the U.S. pension plan assets was \\n6.7%, 6.1% and 8.3%, respectively. The annualized return since inception was 9.9%.\\nThe weighted-average assumptions for health care cost trend rates were as follows:\\nDecember 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\nHealth care cost trend rate assumed for next year\\n 8.50% \\n 8.25% \\nRate to which the trend rate is assumed to decline (the ultimate trend rate)\\n 6.00% \\n 5.50% \\nYear that the trend rate reaches the ultimate trend rate\\n2029\\n2030\\nWe review external data and our own historical trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rate \\nassumptions. The Company’s U.S. postretirement health care benefits are primarily provided through plans with either a capped \\nCompany cost or a defined-dollar benefit. This limits the effects of health care inflation on the Company.\\nCash Flows\\nThe expected benefit payments for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans for the 10 years succeeding December 31, \\n2023 are as follows (in millions):\\n2024\\n2025\\n2026\\n2027\\n2028\\n2029-2033\\nBenefit payments for pension plans\\n$ \\n654 $ \\n615 $ \\n611 $ \\n614 $ \\n489 $ \\n2,421 \\nBenefit payments for other postretirement\\n   benefit plans\\n \\n49  \\n29  \\n27  \\n24  \\n23  \\n99 \\nTotal\\n$ \\n703 $ \\n644 $ \\n638 $ \\n638 $ \\n512 $ \\n2,520 \\nThe Company anticipates making contributions of approximately $47 million to our pension trusts in 2024, all of which will be \\nallocated to our international plans. These contributions are made in accordance with local laws and tax regulations.\\nDefined Contribution Plans\\nOur Company sponsors qualified defined contribution plans covering substantially all U.S. employees. Under the largest U.S. \\ndefined contribution plan, we match participants’ contributions up to a maximum of 3.0% to 3.5% of compensation, subject to \\nan IRS limit on compensation. The Company’s expense for the U.S. plans totaled $44 million, $45 million and $32 million in \\n2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We also sponsor defined contribution plans in certain locations outside the United States. \\nThe Company’s expense for these plans totaled $82 million in 2023 and $79 million in both 2022 and 2021.\\nMulti-Employer Retirement Plans\\nThe Company participates in various multi-employer retirement plans, which are designed to provide benefits to, or on behalf \\nof, employees of multiple employers. These plans are typically established under collective bargaining agreements. Multi-\\nemployer retirement plans are generally governed by a board of trustees composed of representatives of both management and \\nlabor and are generally funded through employer contributions.\\nThe Company’s expense for multi-employer retirement plans totaled $1 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021. The plans we currently \\nparticipate in have contractual arrangements that extend into 2026. If, in the future, we choose to withdraw from any of the \\nmulti-employer retirement plans in which we currently participate, we would record the appropriate withdrawal liability, if any, \\nat that time.\\n102\\nNOTE 15: INCOME TAXES \\nIncome before income taxes consisted of the following (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nUnited States\\n$ \\n2,766 \\n$ \\n3,452 \\n$ \\n3,538 \\nInternational\\n \\n10,186 \\n \\n8,234 \\n \\n8,887 \\nTotal\\n$ \\n12,952 \\n$ \\n11,686 \\n$ \\n12,425 \\nIncome taxes consisted of the following (in millions):\\nUnited States\\nState and Local\\nInternational\\nTotal\\n2023\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nCurrent\\n$ \\n83 $ \\n129 $ \\n2,039 \\n$ \\n2,251 \\nDeferred\\n \\n(135)  \\n(78)  \\n211 \\n \\n(2) \\n2022\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nCurrent\\n$ \\n468 $ \\n118 $ \\n1,651 \\n$ \\n2,237 \\nDeferred\\n \\n(121)  \\n(4)  \\n3 \\n \\n(122) \\n2021\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nCurrent\\n$ \\n243 $ \\n106 $ \\n1,378 \\n$ \\n1,727 \\nDeferred\\n \\n229  \\n(10)  \\n675 1  \\n894 \\n1 Includes net tax expense of $195 million related to changes in tax laws in certain foreign jurisdictions.\\nWe made income tax payments of $2,580 million, $2,403 million and $2,168 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, \\nwhich included $723 million, $385 million, and $385 million, respectively, of the one-time transition tax required by the Tax \\nReform Act.\\nOur effective tax rate reflects the tax benefits of having significant operations outside the United States, which are generally \\ntaxed at rates lower than the statutory U.S. federal tax rate. As a result of employment actions and capital investments made by \\nthe Company, certain tax jurisdictions provide income tax incentive grants, including Brazil, Costa Rica, Singapore and \\nEswatini. The terms of these grants expire from 2025 to 2036. We anticipate that we will be able to extend or renew the grants \\nin these locations. Tax incentive grants favorably impacted our income tax expense by $332 million, $406 million and \\n$381 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Refer to Note 2.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we have not recorded incremental income taxes for additional outside basis differences of \\n$8.5 billion in our investments in foreign subsidiaries, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign \\n103\\noperations. Determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any additional outside basis differences in \\nthese entities is not practicable.\\nThe Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) provisions of the Tax Reform Act require the Company to include in its \\nU.S. income tax return each foreign subsidiary’s earnings in excess of an allowable return on the foreign subsidiary’s tangible \\nassets. An accounting policy election is available to either account for the tax effects of GILTI in the period that is subject to \\nsuch taxes or to provide deferred taxes for book and tax basis differences that upon reversal may be subject to such taxes. We \\nhave elected to account for the tax effects of these provisions in the period that is subject to such tax and the impact is reflected \\nin our full year provision.\\nThe Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in all applicable jurisdictions, including the U.S. federal jurisdiction, \\nU.S. state jurisdictions and foreign jurisdictions. U.S. tax authorities have completed their federal income tax examinations for \\nall years prior to 2007. With respect to U.S. state jurisdictions and foreign jurisdictions, with limited exceptions, the Company \\nand its subsidiaries are no longer subject to income tax audits for years prior to 2007. For U.S. federal and state tax purposes, \\nthe net operating losses and tax credit carryovers that were acquired in connection with our acquisition of Coca-Cola \\nEnterprises Inc.’s former North America business and that were generated from 1990 through 2010 are subject to adjustments \\nuntil the year in which they are utilized is no longer subject to examination. Although the outcome of tax audits is always \\nuncertain, the Company believes that adequate amounts of tax, including interest and penalties, have been provided for in \\naccordance with the applicable accounting guidance.\\nOn November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued the Opinion regarding the Company’s 2015 litigation with the IRS involving \\ntransfer pricing tax adjustments in which the court predominantly sided with the IRS. On November 8, 2023, the Tax Court \\nissued a supplemental opinion, siding with the IRS in concluding both that the blocked-income regulations apply to the \\nCompany’s operations and that the Tax Court opinion in 3M Co. & Subs. v. Commissioner (February 9, 2023) controlled as to \\nthe validity of those regulations. The Company strongly disagrees with the Opinions and intends to vigorously defend its \\nposition. Refer to Note 12.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $929 million. If the Company were to prevail on \\nall uncertain tax positions, the net effect would be a benefit of $632 million, exclusive of any benefits related to interest and \\npenalties. The remaining $297 million primarily represents tax benefits that would be received in different tax jurisdictions in \\nthe event the Company did not prevail on all uncertain tax positions.\\nA reconciliation of the changes in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nBalance of unrecognized tax benefits at beginning of year\\n$ \\n926 $ \\n906 $ \\n915 \\nIncrease related to prior period tax positions\\n \\n2  \\n6  \\n9 \\nDecrease related to prior period tax positions\\n \\n(25)  \\n—  \\n(50) \\nIncrease related to current period tax positions\\n \\n32  \\n38  \\n37 \\nDecrease related to settlements with taxing authorities\\n \\n—  \\n(2)  \\n(4) \\nDecrease due to lapse of the applicable statute of limitations\\n \\n(2)  \\n—  \\n— \\nEffect of foreign currency translation\\n \\n(4)  \\n(22)  \\n(1) \\nBalance of unrecognized tax benefits at end of year\\n$ \\n929 $ \\n926 $ \\n906 \\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the line item income taxes in our \\nconsolidated statement of income. The Company had $544 million, $496 million and $453 million in interest and penalties \\nrelated to unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Of these amounts, expense \\nof $48 million, $43 million and $62 million was recognized in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. If the Company were to \\nprevail on all uncertain tax positions, the reversal of this accrual would be a benefit to the Company’s effective tax rate.\\nIt is expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next 12 months; however, we do not expect any \\nchanges will have a significant impact on our consolidated statement of income or consolidated balance sheet. These changes \\nmay be the result of settlements of ongoing audits, statute of limitations expiring or final settlements in transfer pricing matters \\nthat are the subject of litigation. Currently, an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible outcomes cannot be made.\\n104\\nThe tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities consisted of the \\nfollowing (in millions):\\nDecember 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\nDeferred tax assets:\\n \\n \\nProperty, plant and equipment\\n$ \\n25 $ \\n40 \\nTrademarks and other intangible assets\\n \\n1,414  \\n1,617 \\nEquity method investments (including net foreign currency translation adjustments)\\n \\n239  \\n366 \\nDerivative financial instruments\\n \\n156  \\n207 \\nOther liabilities\\n \\n1,709  \\n1,503 \\nBenefit plans\\n \\n554  \\n522 \\nNet operating loss carryforwards\\n \\n273  \\n248 \\nOther\\n \\n445  \\n530 \\nGross deferred tax assets\\n \\n4,815  \\n5,033 \\nValuation allowances\\n \\n(396)  \\n(424) \\nTotal deferred tax assets\\n$ \\n4,419 $ \\n4,609 \\nDeferred tax liabilities:\\n \\n \\nProperty, plant and equipment\\n$ \\n(748) $ \\n(741) \\nTrademarks and other intangible assets\\n \\n(1,917)  \\n(1,843) \\nEquity method investments (including net foreign currency translation adjustments)\\n \\n(1,633)  \\n(1,632) \\nDerivative financial instruments\\n \\n(282)  \\n(488) \\nOther liabilities\\n \\n(330)  \\n(372) \\nBenefit plans\\n \\n(428)  \\n(490) \\nOther\\n \\n(159)  \\n(211) \\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\\n$ \\n(5,497) $ \\n(5,777) \\nNet deferred tax assets (liabilities)\\n$ \\n(1,078) $ \\n(1,168) \\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had net deferred tax assets of $273 million and $398 million, respectively, located in \\ncountries outside the United States.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $1,705 million of loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income.

Current evidence does not suggest that we will realize sufficient taxable \\nincome of the appropriate character within the carryforward period to allow us to realize these deferred tax benefits. If we were \\nto identify and implement tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or generate sufficient income of the \\nappropriate character in these jurisdictions in the future, it could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a \\nreduction of income tax expense. The Company believes that it will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax \\nbenefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheet.\\nIn 2023, the Company recognized a net decrease of $28 million in its valuation allowances, primarily due to net decreases in the \\ndeferred tax assets and related valuation allowances on a certain equity method investment, certain excess foreign tax credit \\ncarryforwards and the changes in net operating losses in the normal course of business. \\n105\\nIn 2022, the Company recognized a net increase of $23 million in its valuation allowances. The increase was primarily due to \\nsignificant negative evidence on the utilization of excess foreign tax credits generated in the current year. The increase was also \\ndue to net increases in the deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances on certain equity method investments and the \\nchanges in net operating losses in the normal course of business. \\nIn 2021, the Company recognized a net decrease of $5 million in its valuation allowances.

Refer to Note 2.\\nNOTE 17: FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS \\nU.S. GAAP defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit \\nprice) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market \\nparticipants at the measurement date. Additionally, the inputs used to measure fair value are prioritized based on a three-level \\nhierarchy. This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable \\ninputs. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:\\n• Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\\n• Level 2 — Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1. We value assets and liabilities included in this \\nlevel using dealer and broker quotations, certain pricing models, bid prices, quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities \\nin active markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.\\n• Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value \\nof the assets or liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar \\ntechniques that use significant unobservable inputs.\\n109\\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements\\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP, certain assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. For \\nour Company, the only assets and liabilities that are adjusted to fair value on a recurring basis are investments in equity \\nsecurities with readily determinable fair values, debt securities classified as trading or available-for-sale, derivative financial \\ninstruments and our contingent consideration liability. Additionally, the Company adjusts the carrying value of certain long-\\nterm debt as a result of the Company’s fair value hedging strategy.\\nInvestments in Debt and Equity Securities\\nThe fair values of our investments in debt and equity securities using quoted market prices from daily exchange traded markets \\nare based on the closing price as of the balance sheet date and are classified as Level 1. The fair values of our investments in \\ndebt and equity securities classified as Level 2 are priced using quoted market prices for similar instruments or nonbinding \\nmarket prices that are corroborated by observable market data. Inputs into these valuation techniques include actual trade data, \\nbenchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes and other similar data. These inputs are obtained from quoted market prices, \\nindependent pricing vendors or other sources.\\nDerivative Financial Instruments\\nThe fair values of our futures contracts are primarily determined using quoted contract prices on futures exchange markets. The \\nfair values of these instruments are based on the closing contract prices as of the balance sheet date and are classified as \\nLevel 1.\\nThe fair values of our derivative instruments other than futures are determined using standard valuation models. The significant \\ninputs used in these models are readily available in public markets, or can be derived from observable market transactions, and \\ntherefore have been classified as Level 2. Inputs used in these standard valuation models for derivative instruments other than \\nfutures include the applicable exchange rates, forward rates, interest rates, discount rates and commodity prices. The standard \\nvaluation model for options also uses implied volatility as an additional input. The discount rates are based on the historical \\nU.S. Deposit or U.S. Treasury rates, and the implied volatility specific to options is based on quoted rates from financial \\ninstitutions.\\nIncluded in the fair values of derivative instruments is an adjustment for nonperformance risk. The adjustment is based on \\ncurrent credit default swap (“CDS”) rates applied to each contract, by counterparty. We use our counterparty’s CDS rate when \\nwe are in an asset position and our own CDS rate when we are in a liability position. The adjustment for nonperformance risk \\ndid not have a significant impact on the estimated fair values of our derivative instruments. \\nThe following tables summarize those assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in millions):\\nDecember 31, 2023\\nLevel 1\\nLevel 2\\nLevel 3\\nOther3\\nNetting\\nAdjustment\\n4\\nFair Value\\nMeasurements\\nAssets:\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nEquity securities with readily determinable values1\\n$ 1,727 $ \\n188 $ \\n6 \\n$ \\n85 $ \\n— \\n$ \\n2,006 \\nDebt securities1\\n \\n—  1,172  \\n3 \\n \\n—  \\n— \\n \\n1,175 \\nDerivatives2\\n \\n—  \\n275  \\n— \\n \\n—  \\n(222) 6  \\n53 8\\nTotal assets\\n$ 1,727 $ 1,635 $ \\n9 \\n$ \\n85 $ \\n(222) $ \\n3,234 \\nLiabilities:\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nContingent consideration liability\\n$ \\n— $ \\n— $ 3,017 5 $ \\n— $ \\n— \\n$ \\n3,017 \\nDerivatives2\\n \\n3  1,445  \\n— \\n \\n—  \\n(1,256) 7  \\n192 8\\nTotal liabilities\\n$ \\n3 $ 1,445 $ 3,017 \\n$ \\n— $ \\n(1,256) $ \\n3,209 \\n1 Refer to Note 4 for additional information related to the composition of our equity securities with readily determinable values and debt \\nsecurities.\\n2 Refer to Note 5 for additional information related to the composition of our derivatives portfolio.\\n3 Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been \\ncategorized in the fair value hierarchy but are included to reconcile to the amounts presented in Note 4.\\n4 Amounts represent the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow the Company to settle net positive and negative \\npositions and also cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparties.

These milestone payments are based on agreed-upon formulas \\nrelated to fairlife’s operating results, the resulting values of which are not subject to a ceiling. The fair value was determined using a Monte \\nCarlo valuation model.

Refer to Note 5 for additional information \\nrelated to the composition of our derivatives portfolio.\\nGross realized and unrealized gains and losses on Level 3 assets and liabilities, excluding the contingent consideration liability, \\nwere not significant for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\\nThe Company recognizes transfers between levels within the hierarchy as of the beginning of the reporting period. Gross \\ntransfers between levels within the hierarchy were not significant for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\\n111\\nNonrecurring Fair Value Measurements\\nIn addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company records assets and liabilities \\nat fair value on a nonrecurring basis as required by U.S. GAAP. Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring \\nbasis as a result of impairment charges or as a result of observable changes in equity securities using the measurement \\nalternative. \\nThe gains and losses on assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are summarized in the following table (in \\nmillions):\\nGains (Losses)\\n \\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023  \\n2022  \\nImpairment of property, plant and equipment\\n$ \\n(46) 1 $ \\n— \\nOther-than-temporary impairment charges\\n \\n(39) 2  \\n(96) 3\\nImpairment of intangible assets\\n \\n— \\n \\n(57) 4\\nValuation of shares in equity method investee\\n \\n— \\n \\n(24) 5\\nTotal\\n$ \\n(85) $ \\n(177) \\n1 The Company recorded an asset impairment charge of $25 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 related to the discontinuation \\nof certain manufacturing operations in Asia Pacific. Additionally, the Company recorded an asset impairment charge of $21 million during \\nthe year ended December 31, 2023 related to the restructuring of our manufacturing operations in the United States. These charges, which \\nwere calculated based on Level 3 inputs, were primarily driven by management’s best estimate of the potential proceeds from the disposal of \\nthe related assets.\\n2 The Company recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $39 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 related to an \\nequity method investee in Latin America. This impairment charge was derived using Level 3 inputs and was primarily driven by revised \\nprojections of future operating results.\\n3 The Company recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $96 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 related to an \\nequity method investee in Russia. This impairment charge was derived using Level 3 inputs and was primarily driven by revised projections \\nof future operating results.\\n4 During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $57 million related to a trademark in Asia \\nPacific, which was primarily driven by a change in brand strategy resulting in revised projections of future operating results for the \\ntrademark. The fair value of this trademark was derived using discounted cash flow analyses based on Level 3 inputs.\\n5 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized a net loss of $24 million on assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. \\nThe net loss was recorded as a result of an equity method investee issuing additional shares of its stock. Accordingly, the Company is \\nrequired to treat this type of transaction as if the Company had sold a proportionate share of its investment. This net loss was determined \\nusing Level 2 inputs and primarily resulted from the recognition of cumulative translation losses.\\nFair Value Measurements for Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets\\nThe fair value hierarchy discussed above is not only applicable to assets and liabilities that are included in our consolidated \\nbalance sheet but is also applied to certain other assets that impact our consolidated financial statements. For example, our \\nCompany sponsors a number of pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Assets contributed to these plans by the \\nCompany become the property of the individual plans. Even though the Company no longer has control over these assets, our \\nconsolidated financial statements are impacted by subsequent fair value adjustments to these assets. The actual return on these \\nassets impacts the Company’s future net periodic benefit cost or income as well as amounts recognized in our consolidated \\nbalance sheet. Refer to Note 14. The Company uses the fair value hierarchy to measure the fair value of assets held by our \\npension and other postretirement benefit plans.\\n112\\nPension Plan Assets\\nThe following table summarizes the levels within the fair value hierarchy for our pension plan assets (in millions):\\nDecember 31, 2023\\nDecember 31, 2022\\nLevel 1\\nLevel 2\\nLevel 3\\nOther 1\\nTotal\\nLevel 1\\nLevel 2\\nLevel 3\\nOther 1\\nTotal\\nCash and cash equivalents\\n$ 163 $ 212 \\n$ \\n— \\n$ \\n— \\n$ 375 \\n$ 146 $ 489 \\n$ \\n— \\n$ \\n— \\n$ 635 \\nEquity securities:\\n \\n \\nU.S.-based companies\\n 1,148  \\n— \\n \\n30 \\n \\n— \\n 1,178 \\n 1,157  \\n7 \\n \\n24 \\n \\n— \\n 1,188 \\nInternational-based companies  \\n904  \\n15 \\n \\n2 \\n \\n— \\n \\n921 \\n \\n920  \\n16 \\n \\n3 \\n \\n— \\n \\n939 \\nFixed-income securities:\\nGovernment bonds\\n \\n107  1,279 \\n \\n— \\n \\n— \\n 1,386 \\n \\n91  1,147 \\n \\n— \\n \\n— \\n 1,238 \\nCorporate bonds and debt\\n   securities\\n \\n—  \\n552 \\n \\n27 \\n \\n— \\n \\n579 \\n \\n—  \\n469 \\n \\n30 \\n \\n— \\n \\n499 \\nMutual, pooled and commingled\\n   funds\\n \\n12  \\n257 \\n \\n— \\n \\n509 4  \\n778 \\n \\n35  \\n202 \\n \\n— \\n \\n530 4  \\n767 \\nHedge funds/limited\\n   partnerships\\n \\n—  \\n— \\n \\n— \\n 1,057 5  1,057 \\n \\n—  \\n— \\n \\n— \\n \\n936 5  \\n936 \\nReal estate\\n \\n—  \\n— \\n \\n— \\n \\n376 6  \\n376 \\n \\n—  \\n— \\n \\n— \\n \\n424 6  \\n424 \\nDerivative financial instruments\\n \\n—  \\n33 2  \\n— \\n \\n— \\n \\n33 \\n \\n—  \\n(14) 2  \\n— \\n \\n— \\n \\n(14) \\nOther\\n \\n—  \\n— \\n \\n323 3  \\n254 7  \\n577 \\n \\n—  \\n— \\n \\n300 3  \\n246 7  \\n546 \\nTotal\\n$ 2,334 $ 2,348 \\n$ 382 \\n$ 2,196 \\n$ 7,260 \\n$ 2,349 $ 2,316 \\n$ 357 \\n$ 2,136 \\n$ 7,158 \\n1 Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been \\ncategorized in the fair value hierarchy but are included to reconcile to the amounts presented in Note 14.\\n2 This class of assets includes investments in interest rate contracts, credit contracts and foreign exchange contracts.\\n3 Includes purchased annuity insurance contracts.\\n4 This class of assets includes actively managed emerging markets equity funds and a collective trust fund for qualified plans, invested \\nprimarily in equity securities of companies in developing and emerging markets.

The financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally \\naccepted in the United States appropriate in the circumstances and, accordingly, include certain amounts based on our best \\njudgments and estimates. Financial information in this report is consistent with that in the financial statements.\\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of internal controls and procedures to \\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial \\nstatements. Our internal control system is supported by a program of internal audits and appropriate reviews by management, \\nwritten policies and guidelines, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a written Code of Business Conduct \\nadopted by our Company’s Board of Directors, applicable to all officers and employees of our Company and subsidiaries. In \\naddition, our Company’s Board of Directors adopted a written Code of Business Conduct for Non-Employee Directors which \\nreflects the same principles and values as our Code of Business Conduct for officers and employees but focuses on matters of \\nrelevance to non-employee Directors.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and, even \\nwhen determined to be effective, can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and \\npresentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may \\nbecome inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may \\ndeteriorate.\\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial \\nreporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”). \\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. \\nIn making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the \\nTreadway Commission (2013 Framework) (“COSO”) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment, \\nmanagement believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, \\n2023.\\nThe Company’s independent auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, a registered public accounting firm, are appointed by the Audit \\nCommittee of our Company’s Board of Directors, subject to ratification by our Company’s shareowners. Ernst & Young LLP \\nhas audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements of The Coca-Cola Company and subsidiaries and the \\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting. The reports of the independent auditors are contained in this report.\\nAudit Committee’s Responsibility\\nThe Audit Committee of our Company’s Board of Directors, composed solely of Directors who are independent in accordance \\nwith the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange listing standards, the Exchange Act, and the Company’s Corporate \\nGovernance Guidelines, meets with the independent auditors, management and internal auditors periodically to discuss internal \\ncontrols along with auditing and financial reporting matters. The Audit Committee reviews with the independent auditors the \\nscope and results of the audit effort. The Audit Committee also meets periodically with the independent auditors and the chief \\ninternal auditor without management present to ensure that the independent auditors and the chief internal auditor have free \\naccess to the Audit Committee. Our Audit Committee’s Report can be found in the Company’s 2024 Proxy Statement.\\n124\\nJames Quincey\\nJohn Murphy\\nChairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive \\nOfficer\\nFebruary 20, 2024\\nPresident and Chief Financial Officer\\nFebruary 20, 2024\\n \\nErin May\\nMark Randazza\\nSenior Vice President and Controller\\nFebruary 20, 2024\\nSenior Vice President, Assistant Controller and Chief \\nAccounting Officer\\nFebruary 20, 2024\\n125\\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\\nTo the Shareowners and the Board of Directors of The Coca-Cola Company\\nOpinion on the Financial Statements \\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Coca-Cola Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of \\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareowners’ equity and cash flows for \\neach of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial \\nstatements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the \\nCompany at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended \\nDecember 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the \\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated \\nFramework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated \\nFebruary 20, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\\nBasis for Opinion\\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the \\nCompany’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be \\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the \\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to \\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits \\nincluded performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and \\nperforming procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and \\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by \\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis \\nfor our opinion.\\nCritical Audit Matters\\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were \\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the \\nfinancial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit \\nmatters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating \\nthe critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \\nAccounting for uncertain tax positions\\nDescription of \\nthe Matter\\nAs described in Note 12 and Note 15 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements, the Company is involved in \\nvarious income tax matters for which the ultimate outcomes are uncertain. As of December 31, 2023, the gross amount of \\nunrecognized tax benefits was $929 million. As described in Note 12, on September 17, 2015 the Company received a \\nStatutory Notice of Deficiency from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for the tax years 2007 through 2009 in the \\namount of $3.3 billion for the period. On November 18, 2020, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion predominantly siding \\nwith the IRS related to the Company’s transfer pricing between its U.S. parent company and certain of its foreign affiliates \\nfor tax years 2007 through 2009. On November 8, 2023, the U.S. Tax Court issued a supplemental opinion, siding with the \\nIRS.\\nWhile the Company continues to disagree with the IRS positions and the portions of the opinion affirming such positions, it \\nis possible that some portion or all of the adjustment proposed by the IRS could ultimately be upheld. As a result of the \\napplication of ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes, the Company has recorded a tax reserve of $439 million for this \\nmatter as of December 31, 2023. \\nAuditing management’s evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including the uncertain tax position associated with the IRS \\nnotice and opinion, was especially challenging due to the level of subjectivity and significant judgment associated with the \\nrecognition and measurement of the tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained. \\n126\\nHow We \\nAddressed the \\nMatter in Our \\nAudit\\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the effectiveness of controls over the Company’s \\naccounting process for uncertain tax positions. Our procedures included testing controls addressing the completeness of \\nuncertain tax positions, controls relating to the identification and recognition of the uncertain tax positions, controls over \\nthe measurement of the unrecognized tax benefit, and controls over the identification of developments related to existing \\nuncertain tax positions. \\nOur audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the assumptions the Company used to assess its uncertain tax \\npositions and related unrecognized tax benefit amounts by jurisdiction. We also tested the completeness and accuracy of \\nthe underlying data used in the identification and measurement of uncertain tax positions. We evaluated evidence of \\nmanagement’s assessment of the opinion, including inquiries of tax counsel, inspection of technical memos, and written \\nrepresentations of management. We involved professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in our evaluation \\nof the tax technical merits of the Company’s assessment, including the assessment of whether the tax positions are more \\nlikely than not to be sustained, the amount of the potential benefits to be realized, and the application of relevant tax law. \\nWe also assessed the Company’s disclosures of uncertain tax positions included in Note 12 and Note 15.\\nValuation of trademarks with indefinite lives and goodwill\\nDescription of \\nthe Matter\\nAs described in Note 1 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements, the Company performs an annual impairment \\ntest of its indefinite-lived intangible assets, including trademarks with indefinite lives and goodwill, or more frequently if \\nevents or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired. Each impairment test may be qualitative or quantitative. \\nTrademarks with indefinite lives and goodwill were $14.3 billion and $18.4 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2023.\\nAuditing the valuation of trademarks with indefinite lives and reporting units with goodwill involved complex judgment \\ndue to the significant estimation required in determining the fair value of the trademarks with indefinite lives and related \\nreporting units with goodwill, respectively. Specifically, the fair value estimates were sensitive to significant assumptions \\nabout future market and economic conditions. Significant assumptions used in the Company’s fair value estimates included \\nsales volume, pricing, royalty rates, long-term growth rates, and discount rates, as applicable. \\nHow We \\nAddressed the \\nMatter in Our \\nAudit\\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s \\nannual impairment tests for trademarks with indefinite lives and reporting units with goodwill. For example, we tested \\nmanagement’s risk assessment process to determine whether to perform a quantitative or qualitative test and management’s \\nreview controls over the valuation models and underlying assumptions used to develop such estimates. For impairment \\ntests of reporting units with goodwill, we also tested controls over the determination of the carrying value of the reporting \\nunits. We tested the estimated fair values of the trademarks with indefinite lives and reporting units with goodwill based on \\nour risk assessments. \\nOur audit procedures included, among others, comparing significant judgmental inputs to observable third party and \\nindustry sources, considering other observable market transactions, and evaluating the reasonableness of management’s \\nprojected financial information by comparing to third party industry projections, third party economic growth projections, \\nand other internal and external data. We performed sensitivity analyses of certain significant assumptions to evaluate the \\nchange in the fair value of the trademarks with indefinite lives and reporting units with goodwill and also assessed the \\nhistorical accuracy of management’s estimates. In addition, we involved specialists to assist in our evaluation of certain \\nsignificant assumptions used in the Company’s discounted cash flow analyses. We also assessed the Company’s disclosure \\nof its annual impairment tests included in Note 1.\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP                                                                                                                           \\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1921.\\nAtlanta, Georgia\\nFebruary 20, 2024\\n127\\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\\nTo the Shareowners and the Board of Directors of The Coca-Cola Company\\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \\nWe have audited The Coca-Cola Company and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of  December 31, 2023, based on \\ncriteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway \\nCommission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, The Coca-Cola Company and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in \\nall material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the \\nconsolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, \\ncomprehensive income, shareowners' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the \\nrelated notes and our report dated February 20, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\\nBasis for Opinion\\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the \\neffectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over \\nFinancial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. \\nWe are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance \\nwith the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain \\nreasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, \\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other \\nprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of \\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting \\nprinciples. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of \\nrecords that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide \\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally \\naccepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of \\nmanagement and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized \\nacquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any \\nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or \\nthat the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP                                                                                                                     \\nAtlanta, Georgia\\nFebruary 20, 2024\\n128\\nITEM 9.

However, the absence of these words or similar expressions\\ndoes not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. All statements that address operating performance, events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the\\nfuture\\xa0— including statements relating to volume growth, share of sales and net income per share growth, and statements expressing general views about future operating\\nresults\\xa0— are forward-looking statements. Management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made. However, caution should be taken not\\nto place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements because such statements speak only as of the date when made. Our Company undertakes no obligation to\\npublicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. In addition, forward-\\nlooking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our Company’s actual results to differ materially from historical experience and our present\\nexpectations or projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the possibility that the assumptions used to calculate our estimated aggregate\\nincremental tax and interest liability related to the potential unfavorable outcome of the ongoing tax dispute with the United States Internal Revenue Service could significantly\\nchange; those described in Part\\xa0I, “Item\\xa01A. Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this report; and those described from time to time in our future reports filed with the Securities and\\nExchange Commission.\\nPart I\\nITEM 1.\\xa0\\xa0BUSINESS\\nIn this report, the terms “The Coca-Cola Company,” “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” mean The Coca-Cola Company and all entities included in our consolidated financial\\nstatements.\\nGeneral\\nThe Coca-Cola Company is a total beverage company, and beverage products bearing our trademarks, sold in the United States since 1886, are now sold in more than 200\\ncountries and territories. We own or license and market numerous beverage brands, which we group into the following categories: Trademark Coca-Cola; sparkling flavors;\\nwater, sports, coffee and tea; juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages; and emerging beverages. We own and market five of the world’s top six nonalcoholic\\nsparkling soft drink brands: Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and Diet Coke/Coca-Cola Light.\\nWe make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of independent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and\\nretailers as well as our consolidated bottling and distribution operations. Beverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to the Company account for 2.2\\xa0billion of the\\nestimated 64 billion servings of all beverages consumed worldwide every day.\\nWe believe our success depends on our ability to connect with consumers by providing them with a wide variety of beverage options to meet their desires, needs and lifestyles.\\nOur success further depends on the ability of our people to execute effectively, every day.\\nWe are guided by our purpose, which is to refresh the world and make a difference. Our vision for growth has three connected pillars:\\n• Loved Brands. We craft meaningful brands and a choice of drinks that people love and enjoy and that refresh them in body and spirit.\\n• Done Sustainably. We grow our business in ways that achieve positive change in the world and build a more sustainable future for our planet.\\n• For A Better Shared Future. We invest to improve people’s lives, from our employees to all those who touch our business system, to our investors, to the broad\\ncommunities we call home.\\nThe Coca-Cola Company was incorporated in September 1919 under the laws of the State of Delaware and succeeded to the business of a Georgia corporation with the same\\nname that had been organized in 1892.\\n2\\nOperating Segments\\nThe Company’s operating structure is the basis for our internal financial reporting. Our operating structure includes the following operating segments:\\n• Europe, Middle East and Africa\\n• Latin America\\n• North America\\n• Asia Pacific\\n• Global Ventures\\n• Bottling Investments\\nAdditionally, our operating structure includes operating units, which sit under our four geographic operating segments. The operating units are focused on regional and local\\nexecution and are highly interconnected, with the goal of eliminating duplication of resources and scaling new products more quickly. The operating units work closely with\\nfive global marketing category leadership teams to rapidly scale ideas while staying close to the consumer. The global marketing category leadership teams primarily focus on\\ninnovation as well as marketing efficiency and effectiveness.\\nOur operating structure also includes Corporate, which consists of two components: (1) a center focusing on strategic initiatives, policy, governance and scaling global\\ninitiatives, and (2) a platform services organization supporting the operating units, global marketing category leadership teams and the center by providing efficient and scaled\\nglobal services and capabilities, including, but not limited to, transactional work, data management, consumer analytics, digital commerce and social/digital hubs.\\nFor additional information about our operating segments and Corporate, refer to Note\\xa019 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, “Item 8. Financial\\nStatements and Supplementary Data” of this report.\\nExcept to the extent that differences among operating segments are material to an understanding of our business taken as a whole, the description of our business in this report\\nis presented on a consolidated basis.\\nProducts and Brands\\nAs used in this report:\\n• “concentrates” means flavorings and other ingredients which, when combined with water and, depending on the product, sweeteners (nutritive or non-nutritive) are used\\nto prepare syrups or finished beverages, and includes powders/minerals for purified water products;\\n• “syrups” means intermediate products in the beverage manufacturing process produced by combining concentrates with water and, depending on the product, sweeteners\\n(nutritive or non-nutritive);\\n• “fountain syrups” means syrups that are sold to fountain retailers, such as restaurants and convenience stores, which use dispensing equipment to mix the syrups with\\nsparkling or still water at the time of purchase to produce finished beverages that are served in cups or glasses for immediate consumption;\\n• “Company Trademark Beverages” means beverages bearing our trademarks and certain other beverages bearing trademarks licensed to us by third parties for which we\\nprovide marketing support and from the sale of which we derive an economic benefit; and\\n• “Trademark Coca-Cola Beverages” or “Trademark Coca-Cola” means nonalcoholic beverages bearing the trademark Coca-Cola or any trademark that includes Coca-\\nCola or Coke (that is, Coca-Cola, Diet Coke/Coca-Cola Light and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and all their variations and any line extensions, including caffeine free Diet\\nCoke, Cherry Coke, etc.). Likewise, when we use the capitalized word “Trademark” together with the name of one of our other beverage products (such as “Trademark\\nFanta,” “Trademark Sprite” or “Trademark Simply”), we mean beverages bearing the indicated trademark (that is, Fanta, Sprite or Simply, respectively) and all its\\nvariations and line extensions (such that “Trademark Fanta” includes Fanta Orange, Fanta Zero Orange, Fanta Zero Sugar, Fanta Apple, etc.; “Trademark Sprite”\\nincludes Sprite, Sprite Zero Sugar, etc.; and “Trademark Simply” includes Simply Orange, Simply Apple, Simply Grapefruit, etc.).\\n3\\nOur Company markets, manufactures and sells:\\n• beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as “beverage bases,” and syrups, including fountain syrups (we refer to this part of our business as our “concentrate\\noperations”); and\\n• finished sparkling soft drinks and other beverages (we refer to this part of our business as our “finished product operations”).\\nGenerally, finished product operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations.\\nOur concentrate operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates, syrups and certain finished beverages to authorized bottling operations (to which\\nwe typically refer as our “bottlers” or our “bottling partners”). Our bottling partners either combine concentrates with still or sparkling water and sweeteners (depending on the\\nproduct), or combine syrups with still or sparkling water, to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers, such as cans and\\nrefillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles, bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us\\xa0and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, through\\nwholesalers or other bottlers. In addition, outside the United States, our bottling partners are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, using our concentrates, which\\nthey sell to fountain retailers for use in producing beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain\\nsyrups to fountain retailers. Our concentrate operations are included in our geographic operating segments and our Global Ventures operating segment.\\nOur finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling soft drinks and a variety of other finished beverages to retailers or to distributors and\\nwholesalers who in turn sell the beverages to retailers. These operations consist primarily of our consolidated bottling and distribution operations, which are included in our\\nBottling Investments operating segment. In certain markets, the Company also operates non-bottling finished product operations in which we sell finished beverages to\\ndistributors and wholesalers that are generally not one of the Company’s bottling partners. These operations are generally included in one of our geographic operating segments\\nor our Global Ventures operating segment. Additionally, we sell directly to consumers through retail stores operated by Costa Limited (“Costa”). These sales are included in our\\nGlobal Ventures operating segment. In the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers, who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages\\nfor immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who in turn sell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. These fountain syrup sales are\\nincluded in our North America operating segment.\\nFor information regarding net operating revenues and unit case volume related to our concentrate operations and finished product operations, refer to the heading “Our\\nBusiness\\xa0— General” set forth in Part\\xa0II, “Item\\xa07. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this report.\\nFor information regarding how we measure the volume of Company beverage products sold by the Company and our bottling partners (“Coca-Cola system”), refer to the\\nheading “Operations Review\\xa0— Beverage Volume” set forth in Part\\xa0II, “Item\\xa07. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of\\nthis report.\\nWe own and market numerous valuable beverage brands, including the following:\\n• sparkling soft drinks: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke/Coca-Cola Light, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, Fanta, Fresca, Schweppes , Sprite and Thums Up;\\n• water, sports, coffee and tea: Aquarius, Ayataka, BODYARMOR, Ciel, Costa, Dasani, doğadan, FUZE TEA, Georgia, glacéau smartwater, glacéau vitaminwater, Gold\\nPeak, Ice Dew, I\\xa0LOHAS, Powerade and Topo Chico; and\\n• juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages: AdeS, Del Valle, fairlife, innocent, Minute Maid, Minute Maid Pulpy and Simply.\\nSchweppes is owned by the Company in certain countries other than the United States.\\nIn addition to the beverage brands we own, we also provide marketing support and otherwise participate in the sales of other beverage brands through licenses, joint ventures\\nand strategic relationships. For example, certain Coca-Cola system bottlers distribute certain brands of Monster Beverage Corporation (“Monster”), primarily Monster Energy,\\nin designated territories in the United States, Canada and other international territories pursuant to distribution coordination agreements between the Company and Monster and\\nrelated distribution agreements between Monster and Coca-Cola system bottlers.\\nConsumer demand determines the optimal menu of Company product offerings. Consumer demand can vary from one market to another and can change over time within a\\nsingle market. Our Company continually seeks to further optimize its portfolio of brands, products and services in order to create and satisfy consumer demand in every market.\\n1\\n1 \\n4\\nDistribution System\\nWe make our branded beverage products available to consumers in more than 200 countries and territories through our network of independent bottling partners, distributors,\\nwholesalers and retailers as well as our consolidated bottling and distribution operations. Consumers enjoy finished beverage products bearing trademarks owned by or licensed\\nto the Company at a rate of 2.2 billion servings each day. Our strong and stable bottling and distribution system helps us capture growth by manufacturing, distributing and\\nselling existing, enhanced and new innovative products to consumers throughout the world.\\nThe Coca-Cola system sold 32.7 billion and 31.3 billion unit cases of our products in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Sparkling soft drinks represented 69 percent of our\\nworldwide unit case volume in both 2022 and 2021. Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 46 percent and 47 percent of our worldwide unit case volume in 2022 and 2021,\\nrespectively. In 2022, unit case volume in the United States represented 17 percent of the Company’s worldwide unit case volume. Of the U.S. unit case volume, 61 percent was\\nattributable to sparkling soft drinks. Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 42 percent of U.S. unit case volume. Unit case volume outside the United States represented 83\\npercent of the Company’s worldwide unit case volume in 2022. The countries outside the United States in which our unit case volumes were the largest were Mexico, China,\\nBrazil and India, which together accounted for 32 percent of our worldwide unit case volume. Of the non-U.S. unit case volume, 70 percent was attributable to sparkling soft\\ndrinks. Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 47 percent of non-U.S. unit case volume.\\nOur five largest independent bottling partners based on unit case volume in 2022 were as follows:\\n• Coca-Cola FEMSA,\\xa0S.A.B. de C.V. (“Coca-Cola FEMSA”), which has bottling and distribution operations in Mexico (a substantial part of central Mexico, including\\nMexico City, as well as southeast and northeast Mexico), Guatemala (most of the country), Colombia (most of the country), Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Venezuela,\\nUruguay, Brazil (a major part of the states of São Paulo and Minas Gerais; the states of Mato Grosso do Sul, Paraná and Santa Catarina; and part of the states of Rio\\nGrande do Sul, Goiás and Rio de Janeiro), and Argentina (federal capital of Buenos Aires and surrounding areas);\\n• Coca-Cola Europacific Partners plc (“CCEP”), which has bottling and distribution operations in Andorra, Australia, Belgium, Fiji, continental France, Germany, Great\\nBritain, Iceland, Indonesia, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Papua New Guinea, Portugal, Samoa, Spain and Sweden;\\n• Coca-Cola HBC AG (“Coca-Cola Hellenic”), which has bottling and distribution operations in Armenia, Austria, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia,\\nCyprus, the Czech Republic, Egypt, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Montenegro, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland, Poland,\\nRepublic of Ireland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Ukraine;\\n• Arca Continental, S.A.B. de C.V., which has bottling and distribution operations in northern and western Mexico, northern Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, and the state of\\nTexas and part of the states of New Mexico, Oklahoma and Arkansas in the United States; and\\n• Swire Coca-Cola Limited, which as of December 31, 2022 had bottling and distribution operations in 11 provinces and the Shanghai municipality in mainland China,\\nHong Kong, Taiwan, Cambodia and territories in 13 states in the western United States. Swire Coca-Cola Limited acquired our bottling and distribution operations in\\nVietnam in January 2023.\\nIn 2022, these five bottling partners combined represented 42 percent of our total worldwide unit case volume.\\nBeing a bottler does not create a legal partnership or joint venture between us and our bottlers. Our bottlers are independent contractors and are not our agents.\\nBottler’s Agreements\\nWe have separate contracts, to which we generally refer as “bottler’s agreements,” with our bottling partners under which our bottling partners are granted certain authorizations\\nby us. Subject to specified terms and conditions and certain variations, the bottler’s agreements generally authorize the bottlers to prepare, package, distribute and sell Company\\nTrademark Beverages in authorized containers in (but, subject to applicable local law, generally only in) an identified territory. The bottler is obligated to purchase its entire\\nrequirement of concentrates or syrups for the designated Company Trademark Beverages from the Company or Company-authorized suppliers. We typically agree to refrain\\nfrom selling or distributing, or from authorizing third parties to sell or distribute, the designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the\\nparticular authorized containers. However, we typically reserve for us or our designee the right (1)\\xa0to prepare and package such Company Trademark Beverages in such\\ncontainers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2)\\xa0to prepare, package, distribute and sell such Company Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or\\nform (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some cases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\\n5\\nWhile under most of our bottler’s agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our\\nbottlers, as a practical matter, our Company’s ability to exercise its contractual flexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject,\\nboth outside and within the United States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through\\nshared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers’ always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based\\nconcentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing,\\nthe channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix.\\nAs further discussed below, our bottler’s agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our bottler’s agreements for territories within the\\nUnited States.\\nBottler’s Agreements Outside the United States\\nBottler’s agreements between us and our authorized bottlers outside the United States generally are of stated duration, subject in some cases to possible extensions or renewals.\\nGenerally, these bottler’s agreements are subject to termination by the Company following the occurrence of certain designated events, including defined events of default and\\ncertain changes in ownership or control of the bottlers. Most of the bottler’s agreements in force between us and bottlers outside the United States authorize the bottlers to\\nmanufacture and distribute fountain syrups, usually on a nonexclusive basis.\\nIn certain parts of the world outside the United States, we have not granted comprehensive beverage production and distribution rights to the bottlers. In such instances, we\\nhave authorized certain bottlers to (1) prepare and package Company Trademark Beverages for sale to other bottlers or (2) purchase Company Trademark Beverages from other\\nbottlers for sale and distribution throughout their respective designated territories, often on a nonexclusive basis.\\nBottler’s Agreements Within the United States\\nIn the United States, most bottlers operate under a contract to which we generally refer as a “Comprehensive Beverage Agreement” (“CBA”) that is of stated duration, subject\\nin most cases to renewal rights of bottlers and in some cases to renewal rights of the Company. A small number of bottlers continue to operate under legacy bottler’s agreements\\nwith no stated expiration date for Trademark Coca-Cola Beverages and other cola-flavored Company Trademark Beverages. In all instances, the bottler’s agreements in the\\nUnited States are subject to termination by the Company for nonperformance or upon the occurrence of certain defined events of default that may vary from contract to\\ncontract.\\nCertain U.S. bottlers have been granted certain additional exclusive territory rights for the distribution, promotion, marketing and sale of Company-owned and licensed\\nbeverage brands (as defined by the CBAs). We refer to these bottlers as “expanding participating bottlers” or “EPBs.” EPBs operate under CBAs (“EPB CBAs”) under which\\nthe Company generally retained the rights to produce the applicable beverage products for territories not covered by specific manufacturing agreements, and such bottlers\\npurchase from the Company (or from Company-authorized manufacturing bottlers) substantially all of the finished beverage products needed in order to service the customers\\nin these territories. Each EPB CBA has a term of 10 years and is renewable, in most cases by the bottler, and in some cases by the Company, indefinitely for successive\\nadditional terms of 10 years\\xa0each and includes additional requirements that provide for, among other things, a binding national governance model, mandatory incidence pricing\\nand certain core performance requirements. The Company has also entered into manufacturing agreements that authorize certain EPBs that have executed EPB CBAs to\\nmanufacture certain beverage products for their own account and for supply to other bottlers.\\nIn addition, certain U.S. bottlers that were not granted additional exclusive territory rights, which we refer to as “participating bottlers,” converted their legacy bottler’s\\nagreements to CBAs, to which we refer as “participating bottler CBAs,” each of which has a term of 10 years, is renewable by the bottler indefinitely for successive additional\\nterms of 10 years\\xa0each, and is substantially similar in most material respects to the EPB CBAs, including with respect to requirements for a binding national governance model\\nand mandatory incidence pricing, but includes core performance requirements that vary in certain respects from those in the EPB CBAs.\\nThose bottlers that have not signed CBAs continue to operate under legacy bottler’s agreements that include pricing formulas that generally provide for a baseline price for\\nTrademark Coca-Cola Beverages and other cola-flavored Company Trademark Beverages. This baseline price may be adjusted periodically by the Company, up to a maximum\\nindexed ceiling price, and is adjusted quarterly based upon changes in certain sugar or sweetener prices, as applicable. The U.S. unit case volume prepared, packaged, sold and\\ndistributed under these legacy bottler’s agreements is not material.\\nUnder the terms of the bottler’s agreements, bottlers in the United States generally are not authorized to manufacture fountain syrups. Rather, the Company manufactures and\\nsells fountain syrups to authorized fountain wholesalers (including certain authorized bottlers) and some fountain retailers. These wholesalers in turn sell the syrups, or deliver\\nthem on our behalf, to restaurants and other retailers.\\n6\\nPromotional and Marketing Programs\\nIn addition to conducting our own independent advertising and marketing activities, we may provide promotional and marketing support and/or funds to our bottlers. In most\\ncases, we do this on a discretionary basis under the terms of commitment letters or agreements, even though we are not obligated to do so under the terms of the bottler’s\\nagreements between our Company and the bottlers. Also, on a discretionary basis in most cases, our Company may develop and introduce new products, packages and\\nequipment to assist the bottlers. Likewise, in many instances, we provide promotional and marketing support and/or funds and/or dispensing equipment and repair services to\\nfountain and bottle/can retailers, typically pursuant to marketing agreements. The aggregate amount provided by our Company to bottlers, resellers and other customers of our\\nCompany’s products, principally for participation in promotional and marketing programs, was $4.8\\xa0billion in 2022.\\nInvestments in Bottling Operations\\nMost of our branded beverage products are prepared, packaged, distributed and sold by independent bottling partners. However, from time to time we acquire or take control of\\na bottling operation, often in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance. Owning a bottling operation enables\\nus to compensate for limited local resources; help focus the bottler’s sales and marketing programs; assist in the development of the bottler’s business and information systems;\\nand establish an appropriate capital structure for the bottler. In line with our long-term bottling strategy, we may periodically consider options for divesting or reducing our\\nownership interest in a consolidated bottling operation, typically by selling all or a portion of our interest in the bottling operation to an independent bottler to improve Coca-\\nCola system efficiency. When we sell a consolidated bottling operation to an independent bottling partner in which we have an equity method investment, our Company\\ncontinues to participate in the bottler’s results of operations through our share of the equity method investee’s earnings or losses.\\nIn addition, from time to time we make equity investments representing noncontrolling interests in certain bottling operations with the intention of maximizing the strength and\\nefficiency of the Coca-Cola system’s production, marketing, sales and distribution capabilities around the world by providing expertise and resources to strengthen those\\nbusinesses. These investments are intended to result in increases in unit case volume, net operating revenues and profits at the bottler level, which in turn generate increased\\nsales for our Company’s concentrate operations. When our equity investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over the investee bottler’s operating\\nand financial policies, we account for the investment under the equity method.\\nSeasonality\\nSales of our ready-to-drink beverages are somewhat seasonal, with the second and third calendar quarters historically accounting for the highest sales volumes. The volume of\\nsales in the beverage business may be affected by weather conditions.\\nCompetition\\nThe commercial beverage industry is highly competitive and consists of numerous companies, ranging from small or emerging to very large and well established. These include\\ncompanies that, like our Company, compete globally in multiple geographic areas, as well as businesses that are primarily regional or local in operation. Competitive products\\ninclude numerous nonalcoholic sparkling soft drinks; water products, including flavored and enhanced waters; juices, juice drinks and nectars; dilutables (including syrups and\\npowders); coffees; teas; energy drinks; sports drinks; milk and other dairy-based drinks; plant-based beverages; functional beverages, including vitamin-based products and\\nrelaxation beverages; and various other nonalcoholic beverages. These competitive products are sold to consumers in both ready-to-drink and non-ready-to-drink form. The\\nCompany has directly entered the alcohol beverage category in numerous markets outside the United States. In the United States, the Company has authorized alcohol-licensed\\nthird parties to use certain of our trademarks and related intellectual property on alcohol beverages that contain Company beverage bases. Competitive products include all\\nflavored alcohol beverages containing various alcohol bases. In many of the countries in which we do business, PepsiCo,\\xa0Inc. is a primary competitor. Other significant\\ncompetitors include, but are not limited to, Nestlé S.A., Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., Danone S.A., Suntory Beverage & Food Limited, Unilever, AB InBev, Kirin Holdings,\\nHeineken N.V., Diageo and Red Bull GmbH. We also compete against numerous regional and local companies and, increasingly, against smaller companies that are developing\\nmicrobrands and selling them directly to consumers through e-commerce retailers and other e-commerce platforms. In addition, in some markets, we compete against retailers\\nthat have developed their own store or private-label beverage brands.\\nCompetitive factors impacting our business include, but are not limited to, pricing, advertising, sales promotion programs, \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0in-store displays and point-of-sale marketing,\\ndigital marketing, product and ingredient innovation, increased efficiency in production techniques, the introduction of new packaging as well as new vending and dispensing\\nequipment, contracting with marketing assets (theaters, sports arenas, universities, etc.), and brand and trademark development and protection.\\nOur competitive strengths include leading brands with high levels of consumer recognition and loyalty; a worldwide network of bottlers and distributors of Company products;\\nsophisticated marketing capabilities; and a talented group of dedicated employees. Our competitive challenges include strong competitors in all geographic regions; in many\\ncountries, a concentrated\\n7\\nretail sector with powerful buyers able to freely choose among Company products, products of competitive beverage suppliers and individual retailers’ own store or private-\\nlabel beverage brands; new industry entrants; and dramatic shifts in consumer shopping methods and patterns due to a rapidly evolving digital landscape.\\nRaw Materials\\nWe and our bottling partners use various ingredients in our business, including high fructose corn syrup (“HFCS”), sucrose, aspartame, acesulfame potassium, sucralose,\\nsaccharin, cyclamate, steviol glycosides, ascorbic acid, citric acid, phosphoric acid, caffeine and caramel color; other raw materials such as coffee, orange and other fruit juice\\nand juice concentrates; packaging materials such as polyethylene terephthalate (“PET”), bio-based PET and recycled PET for bottles; and aluminum cans, glass bottles and\\nother containers.\\nWater is a main ingredient in substantially all of our products. While historically we have not experienced significant water supply difficulties, water is a limited natural\\nresource in many parts of the world, and our Company recognizes water availability, quality and sustainability, for both our operations and also the communities where we\\noperate, as one of the key challenges facing our business.\\nIn addition to water, the principal raw materials used in our business are nutritive and non-nutritive sweeteners. In the United States, the principal nutritive sweetener is HFCS,\\nwhich is nutritionally equivalent to sugar. HFCS is available from numerous domestic sources and has historically been subject to fluctuations in its market price. Adverse\\nweather conditions may affect the supply of agricultural commodities from which key ingredients for our products are derived. For example, drought conditions in certain parts\\nof the United States or in other major corn-producing areas of the world may negatively affect the supply of corn, which in turn may result in shortages of and higher prices for\\nHFCS. The principal nutritive sweetener used by our business outside the United States is sucrose (i.e., table sugar), which is also available from numerous sources and has\\nhistorically been subject to fluctuations in its market price. Our Company generally has not experienced any difficulties in obtaining its requirements for nutritive sweeteners. In\\nthe United States, we purchase HFCS to meet our and our bottlers’ requirements with the assistance of Coca-Cola Bottlers’ Sales\\xa0& Services Company\\xa0LLC (“CCBSS”).\\nCCBSS is a limited liability company that is owned by authorized Coca-Cola bottlers doing business in the United States. Among other things, CCBSS provides procurement\\nservices to our North American operations and to our U.S. bottling partners for the purchase of various goods and services, including HFCS.\\nThe principal non-nutritive sweeteners we use in our business are aspartame, acesulfame potassium, sucralose, saccharin, cyclamate and steviol glycosides. Generally, these\\nraw materials are readily available from numerous sources. We purchase sucralose, which we consider a critical raw material, from suppliers in the United States and China.\\nOur Company generally has not experienced major difficulties in obtaining its requirements for non-nutritive sweeteners.\\nJuice and juice concentrate from various fruits, particularly orange juice and orange juice concentrate, are the principal raw materials for our juice and juice drink products. We\\nsource our orange juice and orange juice concentrate primarily from Florida and the Southern Hemisphere (particularly Brazil). We work closely with Cutrale Citrus Juices\\nU.S.A., Inc., our primary supplier of orange juice from Florida and Brazil, to ensure an adequate supply of orange juice and orange juice concentrate that meets our Company’s\\nstandards. However, the citrus industry is impacted by citrus greening disease and the variability of weather conditions that can affect the quality and supply of orange juice and\\norange juice concentrate. In particular, freezing weather or hurricanes in central Florida may result in shortages and higher prices for orange juice and orange juice concentrate\\nthroughout the industry. In addition, citrus greening disease is reducing the number of citrus trees and increasing grower costs and prices.\\nWe generate most of our coffee revenues through Costa. Costa purchases Rainforest Alliance Certified and other green coffee through multiple suppliers. While most of Costa’s\\ncoffee is sourced as readily available bulked commercial grade from Brazil, Vietnam and Colombia, many of Costa’s suppliers have vertically integrated supply chains with\\ndirect access to yields from cooperatives and producer groups.\\nOur consolidated bottling operations and our non-bottling finished product operations also purchase various other raw materials, including, but not limited to, PET resin,\\npreforms and bottles; glass and aluminum bottles; aluminum and steel cans; plastic closures; aseptic fiber packaging; labels; cartons; cases; postmix packaging; and beverage\\ngases, including carbon dioxide and liquid nitrogen. While we generally purchase these raw materials from multiple suppliers and historically have not experienced significant\\nshortages, certain packaging materials, such as aluminum cans, are available from a limited number of suppliers.\\nPatents, Copyrights, Trade Secrets and Trademarks\\nOur Company owns numerous patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other know-how and technology, which we collectively refer to in this report as “technology.” This\\ntechnology generally relates to beverage products and the processes for their production; packages and packaging materials; design and operation of processes and equipment\\nuseful for our business; and\\n8\\ncertain software. Some of the technology is licensed to suppliers and other parties. Trade secrets are an important aspect of our technology, and our sparkling beverage and\\nother beverage formulas are among the important trade secrets of our Company.\\nWe also own numerous trademarks that are very important to our business. Depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are in use and/or their\\nregistrations are properly maintained. Pursuant to our bottler’s agreements, we authorize our bottlers to use applicable Company trademarks in connection with their\\npreparation, packaging, distribution and sale of Company products. In addition, we authorize certain third parties to use applicable Company trademarks in connection with\\ntheir preparation, packaging, distribution and sale of beverages bearing Company trademarks in certain territories. We also grant licenses to third parties from time to time to\\nuse certain of our trademarks in conjunction with certain merchandise and food products.\\nGovernmental Regulation\\nOur Company is required to comply, and it is our policy to comply, with all applicable laws in the countries and territories throughout the world in which we do business. In\\nmany jurisdictions, our operations may come under special scrutiny by competition law authorities due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions.\\nIn the United States, the safety, production, transportation, distribution, advertising, labeling and sale of our Company’s products and their ingredients are subject to the Federal\\nFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; the Federal Trade Commission Act; the Lanham Act; state consumer protection laws; various federal and state laws and regulations governing\\ncompetition and trade practices, including the Robinson-Patman Act of 1936, as amended, and the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914, as amended; federal, state and local workplace\\nhealth and safety laws; various federal, state and local environmental protection laws; privacy and personal data protection laws; and various other federal, state and local\\nstatutes and regulations. Outside the United States, our business is subject to numerous similar statutes and regulations, as well as other legal and regulatory requirements and\\nregulatory reviews.\\nUnder the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (“Proposition 65”) of the state of California, if the state has determined that a substance causes cancer or\\nharms human reproduction or development, a warning must be provided for any product sold in the state that exposes consumers to that substance, unless the conditions of an\\nexemption (described below) can be met. The state maintains lists of these substances and periodically adds other substances to these lists. The detection of even a trace amount\\nof a listed substance can subject an affected product to the requirement of a warning label. However, Proposition 65 exempts a product from a warning if the manufacturer can\\ndemonstrate that the use of that product exposes consumers to a daily quantity of a listed substance that is:\\n• below a “safe harbor” threshold that may be established;\\n• naturally occurring;\\n• the result of necessary cooking; or\\n• subject to another applicable exemption.\\nOne or more substances that are currently on the Proposition 65 list can be detected in certain Company products at low levels that are safe. The Company maintains that the\\npresence of each such substance in Company products is subject to an applicable exemption from the warning requirement or that the product is otherwise in compliance with\\nProposition 65. However, the state of California and other parties have in the past taken a contrary position and may do so in the future. Additionally, the state of California may\\ninclude other substances on the Proposition 65 list in the future.\\nBottlers of our beverage products presently offer, among other beverage containers, nonrefillable recyclable containers in the United States and various other markets around\\nthe world. Some of these bottlers also offer and use refillable containers, which are also recyclable. Legal requirements apply in various jurisdictions in the United States and\\nelsewhere around the world requiring that deposits or certain ecotaxes or fees be charged in connection with the sale, marketing and use of certain beverage containers. The\\nprecise requirements imposed by these measures vary. Other types of statutes and regulations relating to beverage container deposits, recycling, ecotaxes, product stewardship\\nand/or restrictions or bans on the use of certain types of packaging, including certain packaging containing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”), also apply in various\\njurisdictions in the United States and elsewhere around the world. We anticipate that additional such legal requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future at federal,\\nstate and local levels, both in the United States and elsewhere around the world.\\nAll of our Company’s facilities and other operations in the United States and elsewhere around the world are subject to various environmental protection statutes and\\nregulations, including those relating to the use of water resources, discharge of wastewater and air emissions. In addition, increasing concern over climate change is expected to\\ncontinue to result in additional legal or regulatory requirements (both inside and outside the United States) designed to reduce or mitigate the effects of carbon dioxide and other\\ngreenhouse gas emissions on the environment, to discourage the use of plastic materials, to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity\\nconcerns, or to expand disclosure of certain sustainability metrics. Our policy is to comply with all such legal requirements. We have made, and plan on continuing to make,\\nexpenditures\\n9\\nnecessary to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations and to make progress toward achieving our sustainability goals. While compliance has not had a\\nmaterial adverse effect on our Company’s capital expenditures, net income or competitive position, changes in environmental compliance requirements along with expenditures\\nnecessary to comply with such requirements and to make progress toward achieving our sustainability goals could adversely affect our financial performance.\\nWe are also subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations related to cybersecurity, privacy and data protection, including the European Union’s General\\nData Protection Regulation, China’s Personal Information Protection Law, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which became effective on January 1, 2020, as\\namended by the California Privacy Rights Act, which became effective on January 1, 2023, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, which became effective on January 1,\\n2023, and privacy laws in Colorado, Connecticut and Utah, which are slated to take effect during 2023. The interpretation and application of privacy, data protection and data\\nresidency laws are often uncertain and are expanding in the United States and internationally, including in the European Union, Brazil, China and other jurisdictions. We\\nmonitor pending and proposed legislation and regulatory initiatives to ascertain their relevance to and potential impact on our business, and we develop strategies to address\\nregulatory trends and developments, including any required changes to our privacy and data protection compliance programs and policies. Globally, we see a trend toward data\\nprotection laws and regulations increasing in complexity and number, and we anticipate that our obligations will expand commensurately. As a result, our ability to maximize\\nthe utility of our data could be impacted and we may need to modify our practices to accommodate legal and regulatory constraints and obligations or meet consumer\\nexpectations.\\nHuman Capital Management\\nOur people and culture agendas are critical business priorities. Our Board of Directors, through the Talent and Compensation Committee, provides oversight of the Company’s\\npolicies and strategies relating to talent; leadership and culture, including diversity, equity and inclusion; and the Company’s compensation philosophy and programs. The\\nTalent and Compensation Committee also evaluates and approves the Company’s compensation plans, policies and programs applicable to our senior executives. In addition,\\nthe Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance of our Board of Directors oversees succession planning and talent development for our senior executives.\\nEmployees\\nWe believe people are our most important asset, and we strive to attract and retain high-performing talent. As of December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021, our Company had approximately\\n82,500 and 79,000 employees, respectively, of which approximately 9,000 and 9,400, respectively, were located in the United States. The increase in the total number of\\nemployees was primarily due to Costa opening new retail stores as well as the existing Costa retail stores requiring additional staff to meet increased demand, partially offset by\\nthe impact of refranchising our bottling operations in Cambodia. Our Company, through its divisions and subsidiaries, is a party to numerous collective bargaining agreements.\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2022, approximately 600 employees in North America were covered by collective bargaining agreements. These agreements typically have terms of three\\nto five years. We currently anticipate that we will be able to successfully renegotiate such agreements when they expire.\\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\\nWe believe that a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace that mirrors the markets we serve is critical to the Company’s continued growth and success. We take a\\ncomprehensive view of diversity, equity and inclusion across different races, ethnicities, tribes, religions, socioeconomic backgrounds, generations, abilities, and expressions of\\ngender and sexual identity.\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2022, we had approximately 7,800 employees located in the United States, excluding the employees of the Global Ventures operating segment; fairlife,\\nLLC; and BA Sports Nutrition, LLC. Of these 7,800 employees, 40 percent and 48 percent were female and people of color, respectively.\\nWe seek to create a better shared future for everyone our brands and business touch. We are focused on providing access to equal opportunity and fostering belonging both in\\nour workplaces and the local communities we proudly serve. We have publicly announced our 2030 aspirations to be 50 percent led by women globally, and in the United\\nStates, to reflect the U.S. Census racial and ethnic representation at all job grade levels. Each of our operating units outside the United States has developed locally relevant\\ndiversity, equity and inclusion aspirations. Diversity and inclusion metrics, which highlight progress and help drive accountability, are shared with our senior leaders on a\\nquarterly basis. Our Global Women’s Leadership Council, composed of ten senior leaders, focuses on accelerating the development and promotion of women into roles of\\nincreasing responsibility and influence.\\nWe believe our sustainability goals, including our diversity, equity and inclusion aspirations, are key drivers for growth. Accordingly, in 2022, we introduced quantitative and\\nqualitative components into our compensation programs for our executives to promote progress toward our diversity, equity and inclusion aspirations, as well as to encourage\\nthe design and implementation of sustainable diversity, equity and inclusion strategies and programs that foster the recruitment, development and retention of diverse talent.\\n10\\nWe conduct annual pay equity analyses, with regard to gender globally and race/ethnicity in the United States, to help ensure our base pay structures are fair and to identify and\\naddress potential issues or disparities. When appropriate, we adjust base pay. Also, as permitted by local law, during the annual rewards cycle, we perform an adverse impact\\nanalysis on base pay, annual incentives and long-term incentives to help ensure fairness.\\nWe support many employee-led inclusion networks, which are an integral part of operationalizing and embedding our diversity, equity and inclusion strategies. Our inclusion\\nnetworks are regionally structured to meet relevant local needs, and they provide employees with the opportunity to engage with colleagues around the world based on common\\ninterests or backgrounds.\\nTalent and Development\\nThrough our comprehensive global talent management processes, we continuously identify and develop our talent for acceleration in our networked organization. We believe in\\nproviding challenging and diverse experiences and opportunities to our people to help them develop and grow.\\nIn 2022, we launched a global career strategy program called “Thrive,” which is designed to provide clarity to employees on what it means to have a career at the Company.\\nThrough our people-centered approach, we strive to create an integrated, streamlined and inspiring career experience. We believe that development is anchored in acquiring\\nskills and work experiences. We focus on investing in inspirational leadership, capability development, and providing learning opportunities to equip our global workforce with\\nthe skills they need for the future and to improve employee engagement and retention. We provide a range of formal and informal learning programs, which are designed to\\nhelp our employees continuously grow and strengthen their skills throughout their careers. We provide online learning through a robust catalog of digital content as well as\\nexperiential learning opportunities, and we are continually identifying opportunities to provide democratized access to content for all of our employees. We also have Thrive\\nOpportunity Marketplace, a people-centered technology solution that helps connect project opportunities to interested employees who have the capacity, skills and interest in\\nshort-term experiences and assignments. Additionally, we offer comprehensive Company-wide coaching and mentoring programs that support leadership and employee\\ndevelopment at all levels in our organization.\\nWe also believe that talent thrives in a growth-oriented environment where high performance and leadership effectiveness are valued. Our talent practices rely on data and\\nfeedback from multiple sources to help our employees get the transparent and timely feedback they need to be successful.\\nCompensation and Benefits\\nThrough comprehensive and competitive compensation and benefits, ongoing employee learning and development, and a focus on health and well-being, we strive to support\\nour employees in all aspects of their lives. Our compensation programs are designed to reinforce our growth agenda and our talent strategy as well as to drive a strong\\nconnection between the contributions of our employees and their pay.\\nWe believe the structure of our compensation packages provides the appropriate incentives to attract, retain and motivate our employees. We provide base pay that is\\ncompetitive and that aligns with employee positions, skill levels, experience and geographic location. In addition to base pay, we seek to reward employees with annual\\nincentive awards, recognition programs, and equity awards for employees at certain job levels.\\nWe also offer competitive employee benefits packages, which vary by country and region. These employee benefits packages may include: 401(k) plan, pension plan, core and\\nsupplemental life insurance, financial courses and advisors, employee assistance programs, tuition assistance, commuter assistance, adoption assistance, medical and dental\\ninsurance, vision insurance, health savings accounts, health reimbursement and flexible spending accounts, well-being rewards programs, vacation pay, holiday pay, and\\nparental and adoption leave.\\nCulture and Engagement\\nAs our employees work together to achieve our purpose to refresh the world and make a difference, they collectively build and reinforce our culture. Our culture is rooted in our\\ngrowth mindset, which expects each employee, leader and function to be curious, empowered, inclusive and agile. We use a variety of practices to measure and support\\nprogress against these growth behaviors and to ensure that our employees are engaged and fulfilled at work. For example, our Performance Enablement and Culture &\\nEngagement Pulse platforms provide regular opportunities for employees across the organization to provide feedback on how their leaders, teammates and work experiences\\nsupport the growth behaviors. Data from questionnaires are anonymized and plotted against historical results to inform teams and functions on areas of strength and\\nopportunities for improvement. We also encourage regular, live communication across the organization and host quarterly global town halls with our senior leadership that\\ninclude employee question-and-answer sessions. In addition, function-level town halls are held on a \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0regular basis.\\n11\\nAvailable Information\\nThe Company maintains a website at the following address: www.coca-colacompany.com.

RISK FACTORS\\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors, which could materially affect our business, financial condition\\nand results of operations in future periods. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently\\ndeem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods.\\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS\\nUnfavorable general economic and geopolitical conditions could negatively impact our financial results.\\nOur business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected by changes in global economic conditions, including inflation, credit market\\nconditions, increased unemployment, levels of consumer and business confidence, commodity (including energy) prices and supply, a recession or economic slowdown, trade\\npolicies, foreign currency exchange rates, changing policy positions or priorities, levels of government spending and deficits, and actual or anticipated default on sovereign\\ndebt. Many of the jurisdictions in which our products are sold have experienced, and could continue to experience, unfavorable changes in economic conditions, which could\\nnegatively affect the affordability of, and consumer demand for, our beverages. Under difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by\\nforgoing purchases of our products or by shifting away from our beverages to lower-priced products offered by other companies, including private-label brands, which could\\nreduce our profitability and negatively affect our overall financial performance.\\nOther financial uncertainties in our major markets and unstable geopolitical conditions or events in certain markets, including civil unrest, acts of war, terrorism or\\ngovernmental changes, or changes in international relations could undermine global consumer confidence and reduce consumers’ purchasing power, thereby reducing demand\\nfor our products. Product boycotts resulting from political activism could reduce demand for our products. Restrictions on our ability to transfer earnings or capital across\\nborders, price controls, limitations on profits, retaliatory tariffs, import authorization requirements and other restrictions on business activities, which have been or may be\\nimposed or expanded as a result of political and economic instability, deterioration of economic relations between countries or otherwise, could impact our profitability. In\\naddition, U.S. trade sanctions against countries designated by the U.S. government as state sponsors of terrorism and/or financial institutions accepting transactions for\\ncommerce within such countries could increase significantly, which could make it difficult, or even impossible, for us to continue to make sales to bottlers in such countries.\\nThe imposition of retaliatory sanctions against U.S. multinational corporations by countries that are or may become subject to U.S. trade sanctions, or the delisting of our\\nbranded products by retailers in various countries in reaction to U.S. trade sanctions or other governmental actions or policies, could also negatively affect our business.\\nIn March 2022, the Company announced the suspension of its business in Russia. While we have maintained our operations in Ukraine to the extent possible, our business in\\nUkraine has been disrupted due to the conflict. Although we currently do not anticipate that the suspension of our operations in Russia or the disruptions in Ukraine will have a\\nmaterial impact on our results of operations, the conflict has resulted, and could continue to result, in volatile commodity markets, supply chain disruptions, increased risk of\\ncyber incidents or other disruptions to our information systems, reputational risk, heightened risks to employee safety, business disruptions (including labor shortages), reduced\\navailability and increased costs for transportation, energy, packaging and raw materials and other input costs, additional sanctions, export controls and other legislation or\\nregulations (including restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from Russia), or difficulty protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights. The ongoing conflict could\\nresult in the temporary or permanent loss of assets or result in additional impairment charges. We cannot predict how and the extent to which the conflict will continue to affect\\nour employees, operations, customers or business partners or our ability to achieve certain of our sustainability goals.\\n12\\nIncreased competition could hurt our business.\\nWe operate in the highly competitive commercial beverage industry. For additional information regarding the competitive environment in which we operate, including the\\nnames of certain of our significant competitors, refer to the heading “Competition” set forth in Part I, “Item 1. Business” of this report. Our ability to maintain or gain share of\\nsales in the global market or in regional or local markets may be limited as a result of actions by competitors. Competitive pressures may cause the Company and our bottling\\npartners to reduce prices we charge customers or may restrict our and our bottlers’ ability to increase prices, as may be necessary in response to commodity and other cost\\nincreases. Such pressures may also increase marketing costs along with in-store placement, slotting and other marketing fees. In addition, the rapid growth of e‑commerce may\\ncreate additional consumer price deflation by, among other things, facilitating comparison shopping, and could potentially threaten the value of some of our legacy route-to-\\nmarket strategies and thus negatively affect revenues. If we do not continuously strengthen our capabilities in marketing and innovation to maintain consumer interest, brand\\nloyalty and market share while strategically expanding into other profitable categories of the commercial beverage industry, our business could be negatively affected.\\nIf we are not successful in our innovation activities, our financial results may be negatively affected.\\nAchieving our business growth objectives depends in part on our ability to evolve and improve our existing beverage products through innovation and to successfully develop,\\nintroduce and market new beverage products. The success of our innovation activities depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance and\\ntrends; obtain, maintain and enforce necessary intellectual property rights; and avoid infringing on the intellectual property rights of others. If we are not successful in our\\ninnovation activities, we may not be able to achieve our growth objectives, which may have a negative impact on our financial results.\\nChanges in the retail landscape or the loss of key retail or foodservice customers could adversely affect our financial results.\\nOur industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation in, and the blurring of the lines between, retail channels, particularly in Europe and the United States. Retailers\\nmay seek lower prices from us and our bottling partners, may demand increased marketing or promotional expenditures in support of their businesses, and may be more likely\\nto use their distribution networks to introduce and develop private-label brands, any of which could negatively affect the Coca-Cola system’s profitability. In addition, in\\ndeveloped markets, discounters and value stores are growing at a rapid pace, while in emerging and developing markets, modern trade is growing at a faster pace than\\ntraditional trade outlets. Our industry is also being affected by the rapid growth in sales through e-commerce retailers, e-commerce websites, mobile commerce applications and\\nsubscription services, which may result in a shift away from physical retail operations to digital channels. As we and our bottling partners build e-commerce capabilities, we\\nmay not be able to develop and maintain successful relationships with existing and new e-commerce retailers without experiencing a deterioration of our relationships with key\\ncustomers operating physical retail channels. If we are unable to successfully adapt to the rapidly changing retail landscape, including the rapid growth in digital commerce, our\\nshare of sales, volume growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected. In addition, our success depends in part on our ability to maintain good relationships\\nwith key retail and foodservice customers. The loss of one or more of our key retail or foodservice customers could have an adverse effect on our financial performance.\\nIf we are unable to expand our business in emerging and developing markets, our growth could be negatively affected.\\nOur success depends in part on our ability to grow our business in emerging and developing markets, which in turn depends on economic and political conditions in those\\nmarkets and on our ability to work with local bottlers to make necessary infrastructure enhancements to production facilities, distribution networks, sales equipment and\\ntechnology. Additionally, we rely on local availability of talented management and employees to establish and manage our operations in these markets. Scarcity of, or heavy\\ncompetition for, talented employees could impede our abilities in such markets. Moreover, the supply of our products in emerging and developing markets must match\\nconsumer demand for those products. Due to product price, limited purchasing power and cultural differences, our products may not be accepted in any particular emerging or\\ndeveloping market.\\nIf we do not successfully manage the potential negative consequences of our productivity initiatives, our business operations could be adversely affected.\\nWe believe that improved productivity is essential to achieving our long-term growth objectives and, therefore, a leading priority of our Company is to design and implement\\nthe most effective and efficient business model possible. Consequently, we continuously search for productivity opportunities in our business. Some of the actions we may take\\nfrom time to time in pursuing these opportunities may become a distraction for our managers and employees and may disrupt our ongoing business operations; cause\\ndeterioration in employee morale, which may make it more difficult for us to retain or attract qualified managers and employees; disrupt or weaken the internal control\\nstructures of the affected business operations; and give rise to negative publicity, which could affect our corporate reputation. If we are unable to successfully manage the\\npotential negative consequences of our productivity initiatives, our business operations could be adversely affected.\\n13\\nIf we are unable to attract or retain a highly skilled and diverse workforce, our business could be negatively affected.\\nThe success of our business depends on our Company’s and the Coca-Cola system’s ability to attract, hire, develop, motivate and retain a highly skilled and diverse workforce\\nas well as on our success in nurturing a culture that supports our growth and aligns employees around the Company’s purpose and work that matters most. Competition for,\\nalong with compensation and benefits expectations of, existing and prospective personnel have increased. In addition, the broader labor market is experiencing a shortage of\\nqualified workers, which has further increased the competition we face for qualified employees. We may not be able to successfully compete for, attract or retain the highly\\nskilled and diverse workforce that we want and that our future business needs may require, such as employees with e-commerce, social media and digital marketing and\\nadvertising skills, and/or digital and analytics capabilities. Changes in immigration laws and policies could also make it more difficult for us to recruit or relocate highly skilled\\ntechnical, professional and management personnel to meet our business needs. In addition, the unexpected loss of experienced and highly skilled employees due to an increase\\nin aggressive recruiting for best-in-class talent could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitiveness. Failure to attract, hire, develop, motivate and\\nretain highly skilled and diverse talent; to meet our goals related to fostering an inclusive and diverse culture, including increasing the number of underrepresented employees\\nin the United States; to develop and implement an adequate succession plan for our management team; to maintain a corporate culture that fosters innovation, collaboration and\\ninclusion; or to design and successfully implement flexible work models that meet the expectations of employees and prospective employees could disrupt our operations and\\nadversely affect our business and our future success.\\nDisruption of our supply chain, including increased commodity, raw material, packaging, energy, transportation and other input costs may adversely affect our financial\\ncondition or results of operations.\\nWe have experienced, and could continue to experience, disruptions in our manufacturing operations and supply chain. In connection with our manufacturing and bottling\\noperations, we and our bottling partners are dependent upon, among other things, various ingredients and other raw materials and packaging materials. For additional\\ninformation on the raw materials and supplies we use in our business, refer to the heading “Raw Materials” set forth in Part I, “Item 1. Business” of this report. Some of the raw\\nmaterials and supplies used in the production of our products are available from a limited number of suppliers or from a sole supplier or are in short supply when seasonal\\ndemand is at its peak. Furthermore, some of our suppliers are located in countries experiencing political or other risks and/or unfavorable economic conditions. We and our\\nbottling partners may not be able to maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with these suppliers, and our contingency plans may not be effective in preventing\\ndisruptions that may arise from shortages of any ingredients or other raw materials. In addition, adverse weather conditions may affect the supply of agricultural commodities\\nfrom which key ingredients for our products are derived. Any sustained or significant disruption to the manufacturing or sourcing of products or materials could increase our\\ncosts and interrupt product supply, which could adversely impact our business.\\nWe and our independent bottlers operate a large fleet of trucks and other motor vehicles to distribute beverage products to customers. In addition, we and our independent\\nbottlers use a significant amount of electricity, natural gas and other energy sources to operate production plants, bottling plants and distribution facilities. Throughout 2022,\\nincreases in energy demand, along with supply disruptions exacerbated by the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, resulted in significantly higher energy prices, particularly\\nin Europe, which could continue to impact us and our independent bottlers in the future.\\nThe raw materials and other supplies, including ingredients, agricultural commodities, energy, fuel, packaging materials, transportation, labor and other supply chain inputs that\\nwe use for the production and distribution of our products, are subject to price volatility and fluctuations in availability caused by many factors. These factors include changes\\nin supply and demand; supplier capacity constraints; a deterioration of our or our bottling partners’ relationships with suppliers; inflation; weather conditions (including the\\neffects of climate change); wildfires and other natural disasters; disease or pests (including the impact of citrus greening disease on the citrus industry); agricultural uncertainty;\\nhealth epidemics, pandemics or other contagious outbreaks (including COVID-19); labor shortages, strikes or work stoppages; changes in or the enactment of new laws and\\nregulations; governmental actions or controls (including import/export restrictions, such as new or increased tariffs, sanctions, quotas or trade barriers); port congestion or\\ndelays; transport capacity constraints; cybersecurity incidents or other disruptions; political uncertainties; acts of terrorism; governmental instability; or fluctuations in foreign\\ncurrency exchange rates. Many of our raw materials and supplies are purchased in the open market and the prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation. We expect\\nthe inflationary pressures on input and other costs to continue to impact our business in 2023.\\nOur attempts to offset these cost pressures, such as through price increases of some of our products, may not be successful. Higher product prices may result in reductions in\\nsales volume. Consumers may be less willing to pay a price differential for our branded products and may increasingly purchase lower-priced offerings, or may forgo some\\npurchases altogether. To the extent that price increases are not sufficient to offset higher costs adequately or in a timely manner, and/or if they result in significant decreases in\\nsales volume, our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. Furthermore, we may not be able to offset cost increases through productivity\\ninitiatives or through our commodity hedging activity.\\n14\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and related ongoing impacts may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\\nSince early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and the related actions by governments around the world to attempt to contain the spread of the virus have negatively impacted, and\\ncould continue to negatively impact, our business globally. The extent and nature of governmental actions related to the COVID-19 pandemic have varied across our markets\\nbased upon the then-current extent and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. At times we have experienced a decrease in sales of certain of our products in markets around the\\nworld, as well as a shift in consumer demand to more at-home consumption versus away-from-home consumption. While we have experienced improved trends throughout\\n2021 and 2022 in away-from-home channels and improved margins, our recovery has been asynchronous, and the full extent to which the\\u202fCOVID-19 pandemic will affect our\\nresults of operations, financial condition and cash flows will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain. If COVID-19 infection rates increase, the pandemic\\nintensifies, or continued efforts to curb the pandemic are ineffective, the negative impacts of the pandemic on our sales could be more prolonged and may become more severe\\nthan what we have experienced to date.\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and could continue to disrupt our global supply chain. We and our bottling partners have experienced temporary disruptions in certain\\nof our operations; delays in delivery of concentrates, ingredients, packaging and equipment; temporary plant closures; production slowdowns; and difficulty or delays in\\nsourcing key ingredients and beverage containers. We and our bottling partners may face similar disruptions in the future, which may increase supply chain and packaging\\ncosts, or may result in an inability to secure key ingredients and inputs, which could cause delays in delivering our products to our customers and consumers. Although we are\\nunable to predict the impact on our ability to source materials in the future, we expect supply chain pressures to continue into 2023.\\nIn addition to the above risks, the COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate other risks related to our business, including risks related to changes in the retail landscape or the loss\\nof key retail or foodservice customers; fluctuations in input costs, inflation rates, and foreign currency exchange rates; and the ability of third-party service providers and\\nbusiness partners to fulfill their respective commitments and responsibilities to us in a timely manner and in accordance with the agreed-upon terms. The continuing evolution\\nof the pandemic may also present risks not currently known to us.\\nIf we do not successfully integrate and manage our acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations, or if we are unable to realize a significant portion of the anticipated\\nbenefits of our joint ventures or strategic relationships, our financial results could suffer.\\nWe routinely evaluate opportunities to acquire businesses or brands to expand our beverage portfolio and capabilities. Additionally, from time to time, we have acquired or\\ntaken control of bottling operations, often in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance. We may incur\\nunforeseen liabilities and obligations in connection with acquiring businesses, brands or bottling operations. The expected benefits of business or brand acquisitions, including\\ncost and growth synergies associated with such acquisitions, may take longer to realize than expected or may not be realized at all. Moreover, we may encounter challenges to\\nsuccessfully integrating the operations, technologies, services, products and systems of any acquired businesses in an effective, timely and cost-efficient manner. We may also\\nencounter unexpected difficulties, costs or delays in restructuring and integrating acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations into our Company’s operating, governance,\\nsustainability and internal control structures, including extending our Company’s internal control over financial reporting to newly acquired businesses, which may increase the\\nrisk of failure to prevent misstatements in their financial records and in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, our quality management program, which is designed\\nto ensure product quality and safety, may not be sufficiently robust to effectively manage the expanded range of product offerings introduced through newly acquired\\nbusinesses or brands, which may increase our costs or subject us to negative publicity. Also, we may not be able to successfully manage the additional complexities involved\\nwith overseeing various supply chain models as we expand our product offerings. Our financial performance is impacted by how well we can integrate and manage acquired\\nbusinesses, brands and bottling operations, and we may not be able to achieve our strategic and financial objectives for acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations. If we\\nincur unforeseen liabilities or costs in connection with acquiring or integrating businesses, brands or bottling operations, experience internal control or product quality failures,\\nor are unable to achieve our strategic and financial objectives for acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations, our consolidated results could be negatively affected.\\nWe also participate in the sales of other beverage brands through licenses, joint ventures and strategic relationships. If we are unable to successfully manage our relationships\\nwith our joint venture partners or our strategic relationships, including our relationship with Monster, or if for any other reason we fail to realize all or a significant portion of\\nthe benefits we expect from our joint ventures or strategic relationships, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\\n15\\nIf our third-party service providers and business partners do not satisfactorily fulfill their commitments and responsibilities, our financial results could suffer.\\nIn the conduct of our business, we rely on relationships with third parties, including cloud data storage and other information technology service providers, suppliers,\\ndistributors, contractors, joint venture partners and other external business partners, for certain services in support of key portions of our operations. These third parties are\\nsubject to similar risks as we are relating to cybersecurity, privacy violations, business interruption, and systems and employee failures, and are subject to legal, regulatory and\\nmarket risks of their own. Our third-party service providers and business partners may not fulfill their respective commitments and responsibilities in a timely manner and in\\naccordance with the agreed-upon terms or applicable laws. In addition, while we have procedures in place for assessing risk along with selecting, managing and monitoring our\\nrelationships with third-party service providers and other business partners, we do not have control over their business operations or governance and compliance systems,\\npractices and procedures, which increases our financial, legal, reputational and operational risk. If we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships, or for any\\nreason our third-party service providers or business partners fail to satisfactorily fulfill their commitments and responsibilities, our financial results could suffer.\\nIf we are unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, or if we or our bottling partners experience strikes, work stoppages or labor unrest, our\\nbusiness could suffer.\\nMany of our employees at our key manufacturing locations and bottling plants are covered by collective bargaining agreements. While we generally have been able to\\nrenegotiate collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire and regard our relations with employees and their representatives as generally satisfactory,\\nnegotiations may nevertheless be challenging, as the Company must have competitive cost structures in each market while meeting the compensation and benefits needs of our\\nemployees. If we are unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, our labor costs could increase, which could affect our profit margins. In addition,\\nmany of our bottling partners’ employees are represented by labor unions. Strikes, work stoppages or other forms of labor unrest at any of our major manufacturing facilities or\\nat our bottling operations or our major bottlers’ plants could impair our ability to supply concentrates and syrups to our bottling partners or our bottlers’ ability to supply\\nfinished beverages to customers, which could reduce our net operating revenues and could expose us to customer claims. Furthermore, from time to time we and our bottling\\npartners restructure manufacturing and other operations to improve productivity, which may have negative impacts on employee morale and work performance, result in\\nescalation of grievances and adversely affect the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements. If these labor relations are not effectively managed at the local level, they\\ncould escalate in the form of corporate campaigns supported by the labor organizations and could negatively affect our Company’s overall reputation and brand image, which in\\nturn could have a negative impact on our products’ acceptance by consumers.\\nRISKS RELATED TO CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS\\nObesity and other health-related concerns may reduce demand for some of our products.\\nThere is growing concern among consumers, public health professionals and government agencies about the health problems associated with obesity. Increasing public concern\\nabout obesity; other health-related public concerns surrounding consumption of sweetened beverages; potential new or increased taxes on sweetened beverages by government\\nentities to reduce consumption or to raise revenue; additional governmental regulations concerning the advertising, marketing, labeling, packaging or sale of our sweetened\\nbeverages; and negative publicity resulting from actual or threatened legal actions against us or other companies in our industry relating to the marketing, labeling or sale of\\nsweetened beverages may reduce demand for, or increase the cost of, our sweetened beverages, which could adversely affect our profitability.\\nIf we do not address evolving consumer product and shopping preferences, our business could suffer.\\nConsumer product preferences have evolved and continue to evolve as a result of, among other things, health, wellness and nutrition considerations, including concerns\\nregarding caloric intake associated with sweetened beverages and the perceived undesirability of artificial ingredients; concerns regarding the perceived health effects of, or\\nlocation of origin of, ingredients, raw materials or substances in our products or packaging, including due to the results of third-party studies (whether or not scientifically\\nvalid); shifting consumer demographics; changes in consumer tastes and needs coupled with a rapid expansion of beverage options and delivery methods; changes in consumer\\nlifestyles; concerns regarding the environmental, social and sustainability impact of ingredient sources and the product manufacturing process; consumer emphasis on\\ntransparency related to ingredients we use in our products and collection and recyclability of, and amount of recycled content contained in, our packaging containers and other\\nmaterials; concerns about the health and welfare of animals in our dairy supply chain; and competitive product and pricing pressures. In addition, in many of our markets,\\nshopping patterns are being affected by the digital evolution, with consumers rapidly embracing shopping by way of mobile device applications, e-commerce retailers and e-\\ncommerce websites or platforms. If we fail to address changes in consumer product and shopping preferences, do not successfully anticipate and prepare for future changes in\\nsuch preferences, or are ineffective or slow in developing and implementing appropriate digital transformation initiatives, our share of sales, revenue growth and overall\\nfinancial results could be negatively affected.\\n16\\nProduct safety and quality concerns could negatively affect our business.\\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of all of our products. We have rigorous product safety and quality\\nstandards, which we expect our operations as well as our bottling partners to meet. However, despite our strong commitment to product safety and quality, we or our bottling\\npartners periodically have not met, and may not always meet, these standards, particularly as we expand our product offerings through innovation or acquisitions into beverage\\ncategories, such as value-added dairy and plant-based beverages, that are beyond our traditional range of beverage products. If we or our bottling partners fail to comply with\\napplicable product safety and quality standards, or if our beverage products taken to the market are or become contaminated or adulterated by any means, we may be required to\\nconduct costly product recalls and may become subject to product liability claims and negative publicity, which could cause our business to suffer.\\nPublic debate and concern about perceived negative health consequences of certain ingredients, such as non-nutritive sweeteners and biotechnology-derived substances,\\nand of other substances present in our beverage products or packaging materials, may reduce demand for our beverage products.\\nPublic debate and concern about perceived negative health consequences of certain ingredients in our beverage products, such as synthetic colors, non-nutritive sweeteners and\\nbiotechnology-derived substances; substances that are present in our beverage products naturally or that occur as a result of the manufacturing process, such as 4-\\nmethylimidazole (“4-MEI”), a chemical compound that is formed during the manufacturing of certain types of caramel coloring used in cola-flavored beverages; or substances\\nused in packaging materials, such as bisphenol A (“BPA”), an odorless, tasteless food-grade chemical commonly used in the food and beverage industries as a component in the\\ncoating of the interior of cans, may affect consumers’ preferences and cause them to shift away from some of our beverage products. In addition, increasing public concern\\nabout perceived or potential health consequences of the presence of ingredients or substances in our beverage products or in packaging materials (or alleged presence of\\nsubstances such as PFAS) and/or the results of third-party studies (whether or not scientifically valid) purporting to assess the health implications of consumption of certain\\ningredients or substances present in certain of our products or packaging materials have resulted, and could result, in additional governmental regulations concerning the\\nadvertising, marketing, labeling, packaging or sale of our beverages; potential new or increased taxes on our beverages by government entities; and negative publicity, or actual\\nor threatened legal actions against us or other companies in our industry, all of which could damage the reputation of, and may reduce demand for, our beverage products.\\nIf we are not successful in our efforts to digitalize the Coca-Cola system, our financial results could be negatively affected.\\nThe digital evolution is affecting how we interact with consumers, customers, suppliers, bottlers and other business partners and stakeholders. We believe our future success\\nwill depend in part on our ability to adapt to and thrive in the digital environment. Therefore, one of our top priorities is to digitalize the Coca-Cola system by, among other\\nthings, creating more relevant and more personalized experiences wherever our system interacts with consumers, whether in a digital environment or through digital devices in\\nan otherwise physical environment; finding ways to create more powerful digital tools and capabilities for the Coca-Cola system’s retail customers to enable them to grow their\\nbusinesses; and digitalizing operations through the use of data, artificial intelligence, automation, robotics and digital devices to increase efficiency and productivity. If we are\\nnot successful in our efforts to digitalize the Coca-Cola system, our ability to increase sales and improve margins may be negatively affected and the cost and expenses we have\\nincurred or may incur in connection with our digitalization initiatives may adversely impact our financial performance.\\nIf negative publicity, whether or not warranted, concerning product safety or quality, workplace and human rights, obesity or other issues damages our brand image,\\ncorporate reputation and social license to operate, our business may suffer.\\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to maintain the brand image of our existing products, build the brand image for new products and brand extensions, and\\nmaintain our corporate reputation and social license to operate. However, our continuing investment in advertising and marketing and our strong commitment to product safety\\nand quality and human rights have not always had, and may not in the future always have, the desired impact on our products’ brand image and on consumer preferences.\\nProduct safety or quality issues, actual or perceived, or allegations of product contamination, even when false or unfounded, could tarnish the image of the affected brands and\\nmay cause consumers to choose other products. In some emerging markets, the production and sale of counterfeit or “spurious” products, which we and our bottling partners\\nmay not be able to fully combat, may damage the image and reputation of our products. In addition, from time to time, we and our executives have engaged, and may in the\\nfuture engage, in public policy endeavors that are either directly related to our products and packaging or to our business operations and the general economic climate affecting\\nthe Company. These engagements in public policy debates have been, and could in the future be, the subject of backlash from advocacy groups or others that have a differing\\npoint of view and could result in adverse media and consumer reaction, including product boycotts. Similarly, our sponsorship relationships have subjected us in the past, and\\ncould subject us in the future, to negative publicity as a result of actual or alleged misconduct by individuals, hosts or entities associated with organizations we sponsor or\\nsupport financially or through in-kind contributions. Likewise, campaigns by activists connecting us, or our bottling system or supply\\n17\\nchain, with workplace, human rights or animal welfare issues, whether actual or perceived, could adversely impact our corporate image and reputation. Additionally, negative\\npostings or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company or one of its brands, even if inaccurate or malicious, have in the past, and could in the future,\\ngenerate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the Company. Furthermore, allegations, even if untrue, that we are not respecting internationally\\nrecognized human rights; actual or perceived failure by our suppliers or other business partners to comply with applicable workplace and labor laws, including child labor laws,\\nor their actual or perceived abuse or misuse of migrant workers; actual or perceived failure by our suppliers, joint venture partners or other business partners to engage in proper\\nanimal welfare practices; and adverse publicity surrounding obesity and health concerns related to our products, water usage, environmental impact, labor relations or the like\\ncould negatively affect our Company’s overall reputation and brand image, which in turn could have a negative impact on our products’ acceptance by consumers. In addition,\\nif we fail to respect our employees’ and our supply chain employees’ human rights, or inadvertently discriminate against any group of employees or hiring prospects, our ability\\nto hire and retain the best talent will be diminished, which could have an adverse impact on our overall business.\\nIf we are unable to successfully manage new product launches, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\\nDue to the highly competitive nature of the commercial beverage industry, the Company continually introduces new products and evolves existing products to stimulate\\nconsumer demand. For instance, the Company has directly entered the alcohol beverage category in numerous markets outside the United States, and in the United States, the\\nCompany has authorized alcohol-licensed third parties to use certain of our trademarks and related intellectual property on alcohol beverages that contain Company beverage\\nbases. The success of new and evolved products depends on a number of factors, including timely and successful product development, adherence to new global and/or local\\nstandards of practice, consumer acceptance and stakeholder perception. Such endeavors may also involve significant risks and uncertainties, including greater execution risks;\\nhigher costs; lower rates of sales; distraction of management from existing operations; lower product, category or industry knowledge and expertise; slower than expected or\\ninadequate return on investments; increased competitive pressures; stakeholder scrutiny; and reliance on the performance of third parties. As we become subject to additional\\ngovernmental regulations, including alcohol regulations related to licensing, trade and pricing practices, labeling, advertising, promotion and marketing practices, and\\nrelationships with distributors, we may become exposed to the risk of increased compliance costs and disruptions to our existing business.\\nRISKS RELATED TO THE COCA-COLA SYSTEM\\nWe rely on our bottling partners for a significant portion of our business. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our bottling partners, our business could\\nsuffer.\\nWe generate a significant portion of our net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to independent bottling partners. As independent companies, our bottling\\npartners, some of which are publicly traded companies, make their own business decisions that may not always align with our interests. In addition, some of our bottling\\npartners have the right to manufacture or distribute their own products or certain products of other beverage companies. If we are unable to maintain operating and strategic\\nalignment or agree on appropriate pricing and marketing and advertising support, or if our bottling partners are not satisfied with our brand innovation and development efforts,\\nthey may take actions that, while maximizing \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0their own short-term profits, may be detrimental to our Company or our brands, or they may devote more of their resources\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0to business opportunities or products other than those of the Company. Such actions could, in the long term, have an adverse effect on our profitability.\\nIf our bottling partners’ financial condition deteriorates, our business and financial results could be affected.\\nIn the vast majority of our markets, our products are sold and distributed by independent bottling partners, and we therefore derive a significant portion of our net operating\\nrevenues from sales of concentrates and syrups to independent bottling partners. Accordingly, the success of our business depends in part on our bottling partners’ financial\\nstrength and profitability. While under our agreements with our bottling partners we generally have the right to unilaterally change the prices we charge for our concentrates and\\nsyrups, our ability to do so may be materially limited by our bottling partners’ financial condition and their ability to pass price increases along to their customers. In addition,\\nwe have investments in certain of our bottling partners, which we account for under the equity method, and our operating results include our proportionate share of such\\nbottling partners’ income or loss. Our bottling partners’ financial condition is affected in large part by conditions and events that are beyond our and their control, including\\ncompetitive and general market conditions; the availability of capital and other financing resources on reasonable terms; loss of major customers; changes in or additional\\nregulations; or disruptions of bottling operations that may be caused by strikes, work stoppages, labor unrest, natural disasters or other catastrophic events. A deterioration of\\nthe financial condition or results of operations of one or more of our major bottling partners could adversely affect our net operating revenues from sales of concentrates and\\nsyrups; and, if such deterioration involves one or more of our\\n18\\nequity method investee bottling partners, it could also result in a decrease in our equity income and/or impairments of our equity method investments.\\nWe may from time to time engage in refranchising activities or divestitures of certain brands or businesses, which could adversely affect our business and results of\\noperations.\\nAs part of our strategic initiative to focus on our core business of building brands and leading our system of bottling partners, we continue to seek opportunities to refranchise\\nour consolidated bottling operations. Our refranchising activities require significant attention and effort on the part of, and therefore may be a distraction for, senior\\nmanagement. If we are unable to complete future refranchising transactions on terms and conditions favorable to us, or if our refranchising partners are not efficient or not\\naligned with our long-term vision for the Coca-Cola system, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Additionally, we have divested and may in the\\nfuture divest certain brands or businesses. These divestitures may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition if we are unable to\\noffset impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested brands or businesses, or if we are otherwise unable to achieve the anticipated benefits or cost savings from\\nsuch divestitures.\\nRISKS RELATED TO REGULATORY AND LEGAL MATTERS\\nIncreases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or regulations, or unfavorable resolutions of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial\\nresults.\\nWe are subject to income tax in the United States and numerous other jurisdictions in which we generate profits. Our overall effective income tax rate is a function of applicable\\nlocal tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate, tax treaties between such jurisdictions, and the geographic mix of our income before income taxes, which is itself\\nimpacted by currency movements. Consequently, the isolated or combined effects of unfavorable movements in tax rates, geographic mix or foreign currency exchange rates\\ncould reduce our net income. Tax laws and regulations, including rates of taxation, are subject to revisions by individual taxing jurisdictions, and such revisions may result from\\nmultilateral agreements. Many jurisdictions have enacted legislation and adopted policies resulting from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s\\n(“OECD”) anti-Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project. The OECD is currently coordinating a project on behalf of the G20 and other participating countries which would\\ngrant additional taxing rights over profits earned by multinational enterprises to the countries in which their products are sold and services rendered. Model rules adopted\\npursuant to this project would establish a global per-country minimum tax of 15 percent, and the European Union has approved a directive requiring member states to\\nincorporate similar provisions into their respective domestic laws. The directive requires the rules to initially become effective for fiscal years starting on or after December 31,\\n2023. Other countries have taken similar actions. It is possible that the legislative adoption of these or other proposals could have a material impact on our net income and cash\\nflows. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual income tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable,\\nthe final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions, estimates and accruals. The results of\\naudits or related disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made and\\nfor periods for which the statute of limitations is open.\\nFor instance, the United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) is seeking to increase our U.S. taxable income for tax years 2007 through 2009 by an amount that creates a\\npotential additional U.S. federal income tax liability of approximately $3.3\\xa0billion for that period, plus interest. The Company firmly believes that the IRS’ claims are without\\nmerit and is pursuing, and will continue to pursue, all available administrative and judicial remedies necessary to vigorously defend its position. On November 18, 2020, the\\nU.S. Tax Court (“Tax Court”) issued an opinion (“Opinion”) predominantly siding with the IRS. Although the Company disagrees with the unfavorable portions of the Opinion\\nand intends to vigorously defend its position, considering all avenues of appeal, there is no assurance that the courts will ultimately rule in the Company’s favor. It is therefore\\npossible that all or some of the unfavorable portions of the Opinion could ultimately be upheld. In that event, the Company would be subject to significant additional liabilities\\nfor the years at issue and potentially also for the subsequent years if the unfavorable portions of the Opinion were to be applied to the foreign licensees covered within the scope\\nof the Opinion. Moreover, the IRS could successfully appeal the portions of the Opinion that are favorable to the Company and/or assert new claims for additional tax relating\\nto the subsequent years by broadening the scope to cover additional foreign licensees. These adjustments could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial\\nposition, results of operations and cash flows. Any such adjustments related to years prior to 2018, either in the litigation period or thereafter, may also have an impact on the\\ntransition tax payable as part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform Act”). For additional information regarding the tax litigation, refer to Part I, “Item 3. Legal\\nProceedings” of this report.\\nIncreased or new indirect taxes could negatively affect our business.\\nOur business operations are subject to numerous duties or taxes that are not based on income, sometimes referred to as “indirect taxes,” including import duties, tariffs, excise\\ntaxes, sales or value-added taxes, taxes on sweetened beverages, packaging taxes, carbon taxes, property taxes and payroll taxes, in many of the jurisdictions in which we\\noperate. In addition, in the past, the\\n19\\nU.S. Congress considered imposing a federal excise tax on beverages sweetened with sugar, HFCS or other nutritive sweeteners and may consider similar proposals in the\\nfuture. As federal, state and local governments in the United States and throughout the world experience significant budget deficits, some lawmakers have singled out beverages\\namong a plethora of revenue-raising items and have imposed or increased, or proposed to impose or increase, sales or similar taxes on beverages, particularly sweetened\\nbeverages and alcohol beverages, as well as packaging and/or packaging materials. Increases in or the imposition of new indirect taxes on our business operations or products\\nwould increase the cost of products or, to the extent levied directly on consumers, make our products less affordable, which may negatively impact our net operating revenues\\nand profitability.\\nChanges in laws and regulations relating to beverage containers and packaging could increase our costs and reduce demand for our products.\\nWe and our bottlers offer, among other beverage containers, nonrefillable containers in the United States and in various other markets around the world. Legal requirements\\nhave been enacted in various jurisdictions requiring that deposits or certain ecotaxes or fees be charged in connection with the sale, marketing and use of certain beverage\\ncontainers. Other proposals relating to beverage container deposits, recycling, recycling content, tethered bottle caps, ecotax and/or product stewardship, or prohibitions on\\ncertain types of plastic products, packages and cups (including packaging containing PFAS) have been introduced and/or adopted in various jurisdictions, and we anticipate that\\nsimilar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at federal, state and local levels, both in the United States and elsewhere. Consumers’ increased concerns and\\nchanging attitudes about solid waste streams and environmental responsibility and the related publicity could result in the adoption of additional such legislation or regulations\\nin the future. If these types of requirements are adopted and implemented on a large scale, they could affect our costs or require changes in our distribution model, which could\\nreduce our net operating revenues and profitability.\\nSignificant additional labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products may inhibit sales of affected products.\\nVarious jurisdictions have adopted and may seek to adopt significant additional product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products\\nbecause of what they contain or allegations that they cause adverse health effects. If these types of requirements become applicable to one or more of our products under current\\nor future environmental or health laws or regulations, they may inhibit sales of such products.\\nFor example, under one such law in California, known as Proposition 65, if the state has determined that a substance causes cancer or harms human reproduction or\\ndevelopment, a warning must be provided for any product sold in the state that exposes consumers to that substance, unless the exposure falls under an established safe harbor\\nlevel or another exemption is applicable. For additional information regarding Proposition 65, refer to the heading “Governmental Regulation” set forth in Part I, “Item 1.\\nBusiness” of this report. If we were required to add Proposition 65 warnings on the labels of one or more of our beverage products produced for sale in California, the resulting\\nconsumer reaction to the warnings and potential adverse publicity could negatively affect our sales both in California and in other markets.\\nLitigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation.\\nWe are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, those arising out of our advertising and\\nmarketing practices, product claims and labels, competition, distribution and pricing, intellectual property and commercial disputes, tax disputes, and environmental and\\nemployment matters. We evaluate these litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of\\npotential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we establish reserves and/or disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings, as appropriate. These\\nassessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of management judgment. Actual outcomes or\\nlosses may differ materially from our current assessments and estimates.\\nWe conduct business in markets with high-risk legal compliance environments, which exposes us to increased legal and reputational risk.\\nWe have bottling and other business operations in markets with high-risk legal compliance environments. Our policies and procedures require strict compliance by our\\nemployees and agents with all United States and local laws and regulations and consent orders applicable to our business operations, including those prohibiting improper\\npayments to government officials. Nonetheless, our policies, procedures and related training programs may not always ensure full compliance by our employees and agents\\nwith all applicable legal requirements. Improper conduct by our employees or agents could damage our reputation in the United States and internationally or lead to litigation or\\nlegal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines as well as disgorgement of profits.\\n20\\nFailure to adequately protect, or disputes relating to, trademarks, formulas and other intellectual property rights could harm our business.\\nOur trademarks, formulas and other intellectual property rights (refer to the heading “Patents, Copyrights, Trade Secrets and Trademarks” in Part I, “Item 1. Business” of this\\nreport) are essential to the success of our business. We cannot be certain that the legal steps we are taking around the world are sufficient to protect our intellectual property\\nrights or that, notwithstanding legal protection, others do not or will not infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property rights. If we fail to adequately protect our\\nintellectual property rights, or if changes in laws diminish or remove the current legal protections available to them, the competitiveness of our products may be eroded and our\\nbusiness could suffer. In addition, we could come into conflict with third parties over intellectual property rights, which could result in disruptive and expensive litigation. Any\\nof the foregoing could harm our business.\\nChanges in, or failure to comply with, the laws and regulations applicable to our products or our business operations could increase our costs or reduce our net operating\\nrevenues.\\nOur Company is subject to various laws and regulations in the countries and territories throughout the world in which we do business, including laws and regulations relating to\\ncompetition, distribution and pricing, product safety, advertising and labeling, container deposits, recycling, recycled content, product stewardship, the protection of the\\nenvironment, occupational health and safety, employment and labor practices, personal data protection and privacy, and data security. For additional information regarding laws\\nand regulations applicable to our business, refer to the heading “Governmental Regulation” set forth in Part I, “Item 1. Business” of this report. Changes in applicable laws or\\nregulations or evolving interpretations thereof, changes in enforcement priorities of regulators, and differing or competing regulations and standards across the markets where\\nour products or raw materials are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, have in the past resulted in, and could continue to result in, higher compliance costs, higher capital\\nexpenditures and higher production costs, or make it necessary for us to reformulate certain of our products, resulting in adverse effects on our business. In addition, increased\\nor additional regulations to limit and/or report carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change; to discourage the use of plastic\\nmaterials, including regulations relating to recovery and/or disposal of plastic bottles and other packaging materials due to environmental concerns; or to limit or impose\\nadditional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns, have in the past and could continue to result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures\\nand other financial obligations for us and our bottling partners, which could affect our profitability, or may impede the production, distribution, marketing and sale of our\\nproducts, which could affect our net operating revenues. Failure to comply with various laws and regulations (or allegations thereof), such as U.S. trade sanctions, the U.S.\\nForeign Corrupt Practices Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control trade sanction regulations and anti-boycott regulations; antitrust and competition laws; anti-modern\\nslavery laws; anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws; data privacy laws, including the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation and China’s Personal Information\\nProtection Law; tax laws and regulations; and a variety of other applicable local, national and multinational regulations and laws, could result in litigation or criminal or civil\\nenforcement actions, including voluntary and involuntary document requests, the assessment of damages, the imposition of penalties, the suspension of production or\\ndistribution, costly changes to equipment or processes due to required corrective action, or the cessation or interruption of operations at our or our bottling partners’ facilities, as\\nwell as damage to our or our bottling partners’ image and reputation, all of which could harm our or our bottling partners’ profitability.\\nRISKS RELATED TO FINANCE, ACCOUNTING AND INVESTMENTS\\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\\nWe earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using many currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In 2022, we derived $27.6\\xa0billion of net operating\\nrevenues from operations outside the United States. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, income and\\nexpenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the\\nvalue of the U.S. dollar against other currencies affect our net operating revenues, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies.\\nGlobal events, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, trade disputes, economic sanctions, inflation, increasing interest rates and emerging market volatility, and the\\nresulting uncertainties, may cause currencies to fluctuate in relation to the U.S. dollar. Due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weakness in some currencies may be\\noffset by strength in other currencies over time. We also use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\\nHowever, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing\\ncountries, could materially affect our financial results.\\nIf interest rates increase, our net income could be negatively affected.\\nWe maintain levels of debt that we consider prudent based on our cash flows, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital. We use debt financing to lower our cost\\nof capital, which increases our return on shareowners’ equity. This exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates. When and to the extent appropriate, we use derivative\\nfinancial instruments to reduce our\\n21\\nexposure to interest rate risks. However, our financial risk management program may not be successful in reducing the risks inherent in exposures to interest rate fluctuations.\\nOn December 31, 2021, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, the governing body responsible for regulating the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”),\\nceased to publish certain LIBOR reference rates. However, other LIBOR reference rates, including U.S. dollar overnight, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month maturities,\\nwill continue to be published through June 2023. In preparation for the discontinuation of LIBOR, we have amended, or will amend, our LIBOR-referencing agreements to\\neither reference the Secured Overnight Financing Rate or include mechanics for selecting an alternative rate, but it is possible that these changes may have an adverse impact on\\nour financing costs as compared to LIBOR in the long term. Our interest expense may also be affected by our credit ratings. In assessing our credit strength, credit rating\\nagencies consider our capital structure and financial policies as well as the consolidated balance sheet and other financial information of the Company. In addition, some credit\\nrating agencies also consider financial information of certain of our major bottling partners. It is our expectation that the credit rating agencies will continue using this\\nmethodology. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in our capital structure; our major bottling partners’ financial performance; changes in the credit\\nrating agencies’ methodology in assessing our credit strength; the credit agencies’ perception of the impact of credit market conditions on our or our major bottling partners’\\ncurrent or future financial performance and financial condition; or for any other reason, our cost of borrowing could increase. Additionally, if the credit ratings of certain\\nbottling partners in which we have equity method investments were to be downgraded, such bottling partners’ interest expense could increase, which would reduce our equity\\nincome.\\nIf we are unable to achieve our overall long-term growth objectives, the value of an investment in our Company could be negatively affected.\\nWe have established and publicly announced certain long-term growth objectives. These objectives are based on, among other things, our evaluation of our growth prospects,\\nwhich are generally driven by the sales potential of our many beverage products, some of which are more profitable than others, and on an assessment of the potential price and\\nproduct mix. We may not be able to realize the sales potential and the price and product mix necessary to achieve our long-term growth objectives.\\nDefault by or failure of one or more of our counterparty financial institutions could cause us to incur significant losses.\\nAs part of our hedging activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments, including forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option\\ncontracts, collars and swaps, with various financial institutions. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in\\naccounts with banks or other financial institutions in the United States and abroad. As a result, we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial\\ninstitutions. The risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets. If one of our\\ncounterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or to retrieve our assets that are deposited or held in\\naccounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of\\ndefault by or failure of one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\\nWe may be required to recognize impairment charges that could materially affect our financial results.\\nWe assess our noncurrent assets, including trademarks, goodwill and other intangible assets, equity method investments and other long-lived assets, as and when required by\\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States to determine whether they are impaired and, if they are, we record appropriate impairment charges. Our equity\\nmethod investees also perform similar recoverability and impairment tests, and we record our proportionate share of impairment charges recorded by them adjusted, as\\nappropriate, for the impact of items such as basis differences, deferred taxes and deferred gains. It is possible that we may be required to record significant impairment charges\\nor our proportionate share of significant impairment charges recorded by equity method investees in the future and, if we do so, our net income could be materially adversely\\naffected.\\nRISKS RELATED TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND DATA PRIVACY\\nIf we are unable to protect our information systems against service interruption, misappropriation of data or cybersecurity incidents, our operations could be disrupted, we\\nmay suffer financial losses and our reputation may be damaged.\\nWe rely on networks and information systems and other technology (“information systems”), including the Internet and third-party hosted services, to support a variety of\\nbusiness processes and activities, including procurement and supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection of payments, employee processes, consumer\\nmarketing, mergers and acquisitions, and research and development. We use information systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting\\npurposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting and legal and tax requirements. In addition, we depend on information systems for digital marketing activities and\\nelectronic communications among our locations around the world and between Company employees and our bottlers, customers, suppliers, consumers and other third parties.\\nBecause information systems are critical to many of the Company’s operating activities, our business may be impacted by system shutdowns, service disruptions or\\ncybersecurity incidents. These incidents may be caused by failures during routine\\n22\\noperations, such as system upgrades, or by user errors, as well as network or hardware failures, malicious or disruptive software, unintentional or malicious actions of\\nemployees or contractors, cyberattacks by hackers, criminal groups or nation-state organizations (which may include social engineering, business email compromise, cyber\\nextortion, denial of service, or attempts to exploit vulnerabilities), geopolitical events, natural disasters, failures or impairments of telecommunications networks, or other\\ncatastrophic events. In addition, such cybersecurity incidents could result in unauthorized or accidental access to or disclosure of material confidential information or regulated\\npersonal data. If our information systems or third-party information systems on which we rely suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans\\ndo not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results, and we may lose revenue and profits as a result of our\\ninability to timely manufacture, distribute, invoice and collect payments for concentrates or finished products. Unauthorized or accidental access to, or destruction, loss,\\nalteration, disclosure, falsification or unavailability of, information, or unauthorized access to machines and equipment could result in violations of data protection laws and\\nregulations, misuse or malfunction of machines and equipment, damage to the reputation and credibility of the Company, loss of opportunities to acquire or divest of businesses\\nor brands, and loss of ability to commercialize products developed through research and development efforts and, therefore, could have a negative impact on net operating\\nrevenues. In addition, we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to us, our current or former\\nemployees, our bottling partners, other customers or suppliers, or consumers or other data subjects, and may become exposed to legal action and increased regulatory oversight,\\nincluding governmental investigations, enforcement actions and regulatory fines. The Company could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to\\nremedy the damage caused by a cybersecurity incident or to repair or replace networks and information systems. These risks also may be present to the extent any of our\\nbottling partners, distributors, joint venture partners or suppliers using separate information systems, not integrated with the information systems of the Company, suffers a\\ncybersecurity incident and could result in increased costs related to involvement in investigations or notifications conducted by these third parties. These risks may also be\\npresent to the extent a business we have acquired, but which does not use our information systems, experiences severe damage, a system shutdown, service disruption, or a\\ncybersecurity incident.\\nLike most major corporations, the Company’s information systems are a target of attacks. In addition, third-party providers of data hosting or cloud services, as well as our\\nbottling partners, distributors, joint venture partners, suppliers or acquired businesses that use separate information systems, may experience cybersecurity incidents that may\\ninvolve data we share with them. Although the cybersecurity incidents that we have experienced to date, as well as those reported to us by our third-party partners, have not had\\na material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, such incidents could have a material adverse effect on us in the future. In order to address risks to\\nour information systems, we continue to make investments in personnel, technologies and training. Data protection laws and regulations around the world often require\\n“reasonable,” “appropriate” or “adequate” technical and organizational security measures, and the interpretation and application of those laws and regulations are often\\nuncertain and evolving; there can be no assurance that our security measures will be deemed adequate, appropriate or reasonable by a regulator or court. Moreover, even\\nsecurity measures that are deemed adequate, appropriate, reasonable or in accordance with applicable legal requirements may not protect the information we maintain against\\nincreasingly sophisticated attacks. In addition to potential fines, we could be subject to mandatory corrective action due to a cybersecurity incident, which could adversely\\naffect our business operations and result in substantial costs for years to come. While we have purchased cybersecurity insurance, there are no assurances that the coverage\\nwould be adequate in relation to any incurred losses. Moreover, as cyberattacks increase in frequency and magnitude, we may be unable to obtain cybersecurity insurance in\\namounts and on terms we view as appropriate for our operations.\\nIf we fail to comply with privacy and data protection laws, we could be subject to adverse publicity, business disruption, data loss, government enforcement actions and/or\\nprivate litigation, any of which could negatively affect our business and operating results.\\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we receive, process, transmit and store information relating to identifiable individuals (“personal data”), including employees, former\\nemployees, vendors, third-party personnel, customers and consumers with whom we interact. As a result, we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing\\nlaws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions regarding privacy and data protection. These privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from\\njurisdiction to jurisdiction and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. In addition, new legislation in this area may be enacted in other jurisdictions at any time.\\nThese laws impose operational requirements for companies receiving or processing personal data, and many provide for significant penalties for noncompliance. Some laws\\nand regulations also impose obligations regarding cross-border data transfers of personal data. These requirements with respect to personal data have subjected and may\\ncontinue in the future to subject the Company to, among other things, additional costs and expenses and have required and may in the future require costly changes to our\\nbusiness practices and information technology and security systems, policies, procedures and practices. In addition, some countries are considering or have enacted data\\nlocalization or residency laws, which require that certain data be maintained, stored and/or processed within their country of origin. Maintaining local data centers in individual\\ncountries could increase our operating costs significantly. Our security controls over personal data, the training of employees and vendors on data privacy and data security, and\\nthe policies,\\n23\\nprocedures and practices we have implemented or may implement in the future may not prevent the improper disclosure of personal data by us or the third-party service\\nproviders and vendors whose technology, systems and services we use in connection with the receipt, storage and transmission of personal data. Unauthorized access to or\\nimproper disclosure of personal data in violation of privacy and data protection laws could harm our reputation, cause loss of consumer confidence, subject us to regulatory\\nenforcement actions (including penalties, fines and investigations), and result in private litigation against us, which could result in loss of revenue, increased costs, liability for\\nmonetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, all of which could negatively affect our business and operating results. We have incurred, and will continue to incur,\\nexpenses to comply with privacy and data protection standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards and contractual obligations. Increased regulation of\\ndata collection, use, disclosure and retention practices, including self-regulation and industry standards, changes in existing laws and regulations, enactment of new laws and\\nregulations, increased enforcement activity, and changes in interpretation of laws, could increase our cost of compliance and operation, limit our ability to grow our business or\\notherwise harm our business.\\nRISKS RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL FACTORS\\nOur ability to achieve our sustainability goals and targets is subject to risks, many of which are outside of our control, and our reputation and brands could be harmed if\\nwe fail to meet such goals.\\nCompanies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny from stakeholders related to sustainability, including practices and disclosures related to sustainable packaging;\\nwater stewardship; climate; health and nutrition; human rights; and diversity, equity and inclusion. Our ability to achieve our sustainability goals and targets and to accurately\\nand transparently report our progress presents numerous operational, financial, legal and other risks, and is dependent on the actions of our bottling partners, suppliers and other\\nthird parties, all of which are outside of our control. If we are unable to meet our sustainability goals or evolving stakeholder expectations and industry standards, or if we are\\nperceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for sustainability issues, our reputation, and therefore our ability to sell products, could be negatively\\nimpacted. In addition, in recent years, investor advocacy groups and certain institutional investors have placed increasing importance on sustainability. If, as a result of their\\nassessment of our sustainability practices, certain investors are unsatisfied with our actions or progress, they may reconsider their investment in our Company.\\nAs the nature, scope and complexity of sustainability reporting, due diligence and disclosure requirements expand, we may have to incur additional costs to control, assess and\\nreport on sustainability metrics. Any failure or perceived failure, whether or not valid, to pursue or fulfill our sustainability goals and targets or to satisfy various sustainability\\nreporting standards within the timelines we announce, or at all, could increase the risk of litigation.\\nIncreasing concerns about the environmental impact of plastic bottles and other packaging materials could result in reduced demand for our beverage products and\\nincreased production and distribution costs.\\nThere are increasing concerns among consumers, governments and other stakeholders about the damaging impact of the accumulation of plastic bottles and other packaging\\nmaterials in the environment, particularly in the world’s waterways, lakes and oceans, as well as inefficient use of resources when packaging materials are not included in a\\ncircular economy. We and our bottling partners sell certain of our beverage products in plastic bottles and use other packaging materials that, while largely recyclable, may not\\nbe regularly recovered and recycled due to lack of collection and recycling infrastructure. If we and our bottling partners do not, or are perceived not to, act responsibly to\\naddress plastic materials recoverability and recycling concerns and associated waste management issues, our corporate image and brand reputation could be damaged, which\\nmay cause some consumers to reduce or discontinue consumption of some of our beverage products. In addition, from time to time we establish and publicly announce goals\\nand targets to reduce the Coca-Cola system’s impact on the environment by, for example, increasing our use of recycled content in our packaging materials; increasing our use\\nof packaging materials that are made in part of plant-based renewable materials; expanding our use of reusable packaging (including refillable or returnable glass and plastic\\nbottles, as well as dispensed and fountain delivery models where consumers use refillable containers for our beverages); participating in programs and initiatives to reclaim or\\nrecover bottles and other packaging materials that are already in the environment; and taking other actions and participating in other programs and initiatives organized or\\nsponsored by nongovernmental organizations and other groups. If we and our bottling partners fail to achieve or improperly report on our progress toward achieving our\\nannounced environmental goals and targets, the resulting negative publicity could adversely affect consumer preference for our products. In addition, in response to\\nenvironmental concerns, governmental entities in the United States and in many other jurisdictions around the world have adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations and\\npolicies designed to mandate or encourage plastic packaging waste reduction and an increase in recycling rates and/or recycled content minimums, or, in some cases, restrict or\\neven prohibit the use of certain plastic containers or packaging materials. These regulations and policies, whatever their scope or form, could increase the cost of our beverage\\nproducts or otherwise put the Company at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, our increased focus on reducing plastic containers and other packaging materials waste has\\nin the past and may continue to require us or our bottling partners to incur additional expenses and to increase our capital expenditures. A reduction in consumer demand for our\\nproducts and/or an increase in costs and\\n24\\nexpenditures relating to production and distribution as a result of these environmental concerns regarding plastic bottles and other packaging materials could have an adverse\\neffect on our business and results of operations.\\nWater scarcity and poor quality could negatively impact the Coca-Cola system’s costs and capacity.\\nWater is a main ingredient in substantially all of our products, is vital to the production of the agricultural ingredients on which our business relies and is needed in our\\nmanufacturing process. It also is critical to the prosperity of the communities we serve and the ecosystems in which we operate. Water is a limited resource in many parts of the\\nworld, facing unprecedented challenges from overexploitation, increasing demand for food and other consumer and industrial products whose manufacturing processes require\\nwater, increasing pollution and emerging awareness of potential contaminants, poor management, lack of physical or financial access to water, sociopolitical tensions due to\\nlack of public infrastructure in certain areas of the world and the effects of climate change. As the demand for water continues to increase around the world, and as water\\nbecomes scarcer and the quality of available water deteriorates, the Coca-Cola system may incur higher costs or face capacity constraints and the possibility of reputational\\ndamage, which could adversely affect our profitability.\\nIncreased demand for food products, decreased agricultural productivity and increased regulation of ingredient sourcing due diligence may negatively affect our business.\\nAs part of the manufacture of our beverage products, we and our bottling partners use a number of key ingredients that are derived from agricultural commodities such as\\nsugarcane, corn, sugar beets, citrus, coffee and tea. Increased demand for food products; decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions of the world as a result of\\nchanging weather patterns; increased agricultural regulations, including regulation of ingredient sourcing due diligence; and other factors have in the past, and may in the\\nfuture, limit the availability and/or increase the cost of such agricultural commodities and could impact the food security of communities around the world. If we are unable to\\nimplement programs focused on economic opportunity and environmental sustainability to address these agricultural challenges and fail to make a strategic impact on food\\nsecurity through joint efforts with bottlers, farmers, communities, suppliers and key partners, as well as through our increased and continued investment in sustainable\\nagriculture, our ability to source raw materials for use in our manufacturing processes and the affordability of our products and ultimately our business and results of operations\\ncould be negatively impacted.\\nClimate change and legal or regulatory responses thereto may have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\\nThere is increasing concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures due to increased concentration of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the\\natmosphere is causing significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and an increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Decreased agricultural\\nproductivity in certain regions of the world as a result of changing weather patterns may limit the availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities, such as\\nsugarcane, corn, sugar beets, citrus, coffee and tea, which are important ingredients for our products, and could impact the food security of communities around the world.\\nClimate change may also exacerbate extreme weather, resulting in water scarcity or flooding, and cause a further deterioration of water quality in affected regions, which could\\nlimit water availability for the Coca-Cola system’s bottling operations. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair production capabilities,\\ndisrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products. Increasing concern over climate change also may result in additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to\\nreduce or mitigate the effects of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions on the environment, and/or may result in increased disclosure obligations. Increased energy\\nor compliance costs and expenses due to increased legal or regulatory requirements may cause disruptions in, or an increase in the costs associated with, the manufacturing and\\ndistribution of our beverage products. The effects of climate change and legal or regulatory initiatives to address climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on our\\nbusiness and results of operations. In addition, from time to time we establish and publicly announce goals and targets to reduce the Coca-Cola system’s carbon footprint by\\nincreasing our use of recycled packaging materials, expanding our renewable energy usage, and participating in environmental and sustainability programs and initiatives\\norganized or sponsored by nongovernmental organizations and other groups to reduce greenhouse gas emissions industrywide. If we and our bottling partners fail to achieve or\\nimproperly report on our progress toward achieving our carbon footprint reduction goals and targets, the resulting negative publicity could adversely affect consumer preference\\nfor our beverage products.\\nAdverse weather conditions could reduce the demand for our products.\\nThe sales of our products are influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate. Unusually cold or rainy weather during the summer months\\nmay have a temporary effect on the demand for our products and contribute to lower sales, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations for such periods.\\nITEM 1B.\\xa0\\xa0UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\\nNot applicable.\\n25\\nITEM 2.\\xa0\\xa0PROPERTIES\\nOur worldwide headquarters is located on a 35-acre complex in Atlanta, Georgia. The complex includes several office buildings which are used by Corporate employees and\\nNorth America operating segment employees. In addition, the complex includes technical and engineering facilities along with a reception center.\\nWe own or lease additional facilities, real estate and office space throughout the world, which we use for administrative, manufacturing, processing, packaging, storage,\\nwarehousing, distribution and retail operations. These properties are generally included in the geographic operating segment in which they are located, with the exception of our\\nCosta retail stores, which are included in the Global Ventures operating segment, and facilities related to our consolidated bottling and distribution operations, which are\\nincluded in the Bottling Investments operating segment.\\nThe following table summarizes our principal production facilities, distribution and storage facilities, and retail stores by operating segment and Corporate as of December\\xa031,\\n2022:\\nPrincipal Concentrate and/or\\nSyrup Plants\\nPrincipal Beverage\\nManufacturing/Bottling Plants\\nPrincipal Distribution and\\nStorage Facilities\\nPrincipal Retail Stores\\nOwned\\nLeased\\nOwned\\nLeased\\nOwned\\nLeased\\nOwned\\nLeased\\nEurope, Middle East & Africa\\n5\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n2\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n7\\xa0\\n26\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n13\\xa0\\nLatin America\\n5\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n2\\xa0\\n4\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\nNorth America\\n11\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n5\\xa0\\n4\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n35\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n5\\xa0\\nAsia Pacific\\n7\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n2\\xa0\\n1\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\nGlobal Ventures\\n1\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n2\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n9\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n1,618\\xa0\\nBottling Investments\\n—\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n84\\xa0\\n4\\xa0\\n105\\xa0\\n118\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\nCorporate\\n3\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n5\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\nTotal\\n32\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n93\\xa0\\n8\\xa0\\n116\\xa0\\n198\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n1,636\\xa0\\nManagement believes that our Company’s facilities used for the production of our products are suitable and adequate, that they are being appropriately utilized in line with past\\nexperience, and that they have sufficient production capacity for their present intended purposes. The extent of utilization of our production facilities varies based upon seasonal\\ndemand for our products. However, management believes that additional production can be achieved at the existing facilities by adding personnel and capital equipment or, at\\nsome facilities, by adding shifts of personnel or expanding the facilities. We continuously review our anticipated requirements for facilities and, on the basis of that review, may\\nfrom time to time acquire or lease additional facilities and/or dispose of existing facilities.\\nITEM 3.\\xa0\\xa0LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\\nThe Company is involved in various legal proceedings, including the proceedings specifically discussed below. Management\\nbelieves that, except as disclosed in “U.S. Federal Income Tax Dispute” below, the total liabilities of the Company that may arise as a result of currently pending legal\\nproceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company taken as a whole.\\nAqua-Chem Litigation\\nOn December 20, 2002, the Company filed a lawsuit (The Coca-Cola Company v. Aqua-Chem, Inc., Civil Action No. 2002CV631-50) in the Superior Court of Fulton County,\\nGeorgia (“Georgia Case”), seeking a declaratory judgment that the Company has no obligation to its former subsidiary, Aqua-Chem, Inc., now known as Cleaver-Brooks, Inc.\\n(“Aqua-Chem”), for any past, present or future liabilities or expenses in connection with any claims or lawsuits against Aqua-Chem. Subsequent to the Company’s filing but on\\nthe same day, Aqua-Chem filed a lawsuit (Aqua-Chem, Inc. v. The Coca-Cola Company, Civil Action No. 02CV012179) in the Circuit Court, Civil Division of Milwaukee\\nCounty, Wisconsin (“Wisconsin Case”). In the Wisconsin Case, Aqua-Chem sought a declaratory judgment that the Company is responsible for all liabilities and expenses not\\ncovered by insurance in connection with certain of Aqua-Chem’s general and product liability claims arising from occurrences prior to the Company’s sale of Aqua-Chem in\\n1981, and a judgment for breach of contract in an amount exceeding $9 million for costs incurred by Aqua-Chem to date in connection with such claims. The Wisconsin Case\\ninitially was stayed, pending final resolution of the Georgia Case, and later was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice by Aqua-Chem.\\nThe Company owned Aqua-Chem from 1970 to 1981. During that time, the Company purchased over $400 million of insurance coverage, which also insures Aqua-Chem for\\nsome of its prior and future costs for certain product liability and other claims. The Company sold Aqua-Chem to Lyonnaise American Holding, Inc., in 1981 under the terms of\\na stock sale agreement. The 1981 agreement, and a subsequent 1983 settlement agreement, outlined the parties’ rights and obligations concerning past and future claims and\\nlawsuits involving Aqua-Chem. Cleaver-Brooks, a division of Aqua-Chem, manufactured boilers, some of\\n26\\nwhich contained asbestos gaskets. Aqua-Chem was first named as a defendant in asbestos lawsuits in or around 1985 and currently has approximately 15,000 active claims\\npending against it.\\nThe parties agreed in 2004 to stay the Georgia Case pending the outcome of insurance coverage litigation filed by certain Aqua-Chem insurers on March 26, 2004. In the\\ncoverage action, five plaintiff insurance companies filed suit (Century Indemnity Company, et al. v. Aqua-Chem, Inc., The Coca-Cola Company, et al., Case No. 04CV002852)\\nin the Circuit Court, Civil Division of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, against the Company, Aqua-Chem and 16 insurance companies. Several of the policies that were the\\nsubject of the coverage action had been issued to the Company during the period (1970 to 1981) when the Company owned Aqua-Chem. The complaint sought a determination\\nof the respective rights and obligations under the insurance policies issued with regard to asbestos-related claims against Aqua-Chem. The action also sought a monetary\\njudgment reimbursing any amounts paid by the plaintiffs in excess of their obligations. Two of the insurers, one with a $15\\xa0million policy limit and one with a $25 million\\npolicy limit, asserted cross-claims against the Company, alleging that the Company and/or its insurers are responsible for Aqua-Chem’s asbestos liabilities before any obligation\\nis triggered on the part of the cross-claimant insurers to pay for such costs under their policies.\\nAqua-Chem and the Company filed and obtained a partial summary judgment determination in the coverage action that the insurers for Aqua-Chem and the Company were\\njointly and severally liable for coverage amounts, but reserving judgment on other defenses that might apply. During the course of the Wisconsin insurance coverage litigation,\\nAqua-Chem and the Company reached settlements with several of the insurers, including plaintiffs, who paid funds into escrow accounts for payment of costs arising from the\\nasbestos claims against Aqua-Chem. On July 24, 2007, the Wisconsin trial court entered a final declaratory judgment regarding the rights and obligations of the parties under\\nthe insurance policies issued by the remaining defendant insurers, which judgment was not appealed. The judgment directs, among other things, that each insurer whose policy\\nis triggered is jointly and severally liable for 100 percent of Aqua-Chem’s losses up to policy limits. The court’s judgment concluded the Wisconsin insurance coverage\\nlitigation.\\nThe Company and Aqua-Chem continued to pursue and obtain coverage agreements for the asbestos-related claims against Aqua-Chem with those insurance companies that did\\nnot settle in the Wisconsin insurance coverage litigation. The Company anticipated that a final settlement with three of those insurers (“Chartis insurers”) would be finalized in\\nMay 2011, but the Chartis insurers repudiated their settlement commitments and, as a result, Aqua-Chem and the Company filed suit against them in Wisconsin state court to\\nenforce the coverage-in-place settlement or, in the alternative, to obtain a declaratory judgment validating Aqua-Chem and the Company’s interpretation of the court’s judgment\\nin the Wisconsin insurance coverage litigation.\\nIn February 2012, the parties filed and argued a number of cross-motions for summary judgment related to the issues of the enforceability of the settlement agreement and the\\nexhaustion of policies underlying those of the Chartis insurers. The court granted defendants’ motions for summary judgment that the 2011 Settlement Agreement and 2010\\nTerm Sheet were not binding contracts, but denied their similar motions related to plaintiffs’ claims for promissory and/or equitable estoppel. On or about May 15, 2012, the\\nparties entered into a mutually agreeable settlement/stipulation resolving two major issues: exhaustion of underlying coverage and control of defense. On or about January\\xa010,\\n2013, the parties reached a settlement of the estoppel claims and all of the remaining coverage issues, with the exception of one disputed issue relating to the scope of the\\nChartis insurers’ defense obligations in two policy years. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the Company and Aqua-Chem on that one open issue and\\nentered a final appealable judgment to that effect following the parties’ settlement. On January\\xa023, 2013, the Chartis insurers filed a notice of appeal of the trial court’s summary\\njudgment ruling. On October 29, 2013, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the Company and Aqua-Chem. On November\\xa027,\\n2013, the Chartis insurers filed a petition for review in the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, and on December 11, 2013, the Company filed its opposition to that petition. On April\\n16, 2014, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin denied the Chartis insurers’ petition for review.\\nThe Georgia Case remains subject to the stay agreed to in 2004.\\nU.S. Federal Income Tax Dispute\\nOn September 17, 2015, the Company received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (“Notice”) from the IRS seeking approximately $3.3 billion of additional federal income tax\\nfor years 2007 through 2009. In the Notice, the IRS stated its intent to reallocate over $9 billion of income to the U.S. parent company from certain of its foreign affiliates that\\nthe U.S. parent company licensed to manufacture, distribute, sell, market and promote its products in certain non-U.S. markets.\\nThe Notice concerned the Company’s transfer pricing between its U.S. parent company and certain of its foreign affiliates. IRS rules governing transfer pricing require arm’s-\\nlength pricing of transactions between related parties such as the Company’s U.S. parent and its foreign affiliates.\\nTo resolve the same transfer pricing issue for the tax years 1987 through 1995, the Company and the IRS had agreed in 1996 on an arm’s-length methodology for determining\\nthe amount of U.S. taxable income that the U.S. parent company would report as\\n27\\ncompensation from its foreign licensees. The Company and the IRS memorialized this accord in a closing agreement resolving that dispute (“Closing Agreement”). The Closing\\nAgreement provided that, absent a change in material facts or circumstances or relevant federal tax law, in calculating the Company’s income taxes going forward, the\\nCompany would not be assessed penalties by the IRS for using the agreed-upon tax calculation methodology that the Company and the IRS agreed would be used for the 1987\\nthrough 1995 tax years.\\nThe IRS audited and confirmed the Company’s compliance with the agreed-upon Closing Agreement methodology in five successive audit cycles for tax years 1996 through\\n2006.\\nThe September 17, 2015 Notice from the IRS retroactively rejected the previously agreed-upon methodology for the 2007 through 2009 tax years in favor of an entirely\\ndifferent methodology, without prior notice to the Company. Using the new tax calculation methodology, the IRS reallocated over $9 billion of income to the U.S. parent\\ncompany from its foreign licensees for tax years 2007 through 2009. Consistent with the Closing Agreement, the IRS did not assert penalties, and it has yet to \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0do so.\\nThe IRS designated the Company’s matter for litigation on October 15, 2015. Litigation designation is an IRS determination that forecloses to a company any and all alternative\\nmeans for resolution of a tax dispute. As a result of the IRS’ designation of the Company’s matter for litigation, the Company was forced to either accept the IRS’ newly\\nimposed tax assessment and pay the full amount of the asserted tax or litigate the matter in the federal courts. The matter remains subject to the IRS’ litigation designation,\\npreventing the Company from any attempt to settle or otherwise mutually resolve the matter with the IRS.\\nThe Company consequently initiated litigation by filing a petition in the Tax Court in December 2015, challenging the tax adjustments enumerated in the Notice.\\nPrior to trial, the IRS increased its transfer pricing adjustment by $385 million, resulting in an additional tax adjustment of $135\\xa0million. The Company obtained a summary\\njudgment in its favor on a different matter related to Mexican foreign tax credits, which thereafter effectively reduced the IRS’ potential tax adjustment by $138 million.\\nThe trial was held in the Tax Court from March through May 2018, and final post-trial briefs were filed and exchanged in April 2019.\\nOn November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued the Opinion in which it predominantly sided with the IRS but agreed with the Company that dividends previously paid by the\\nforeign licensees to the U.S. parent company in reliance upon the Closing Agreement should continue to be allowed to offset royalties, including those that would become\\npayable to the Company in accordance with the Opinion. The Tax Court reserved ruling on the effect of Brazilian legal restrictions on the payment of royalties by the\\nCompany’s licensee in Brazil until after the Tax Court issues its opinion in the separate case of 3M Co. & Subs. v. Commissioner, T.C. Docket No. 5816-13 (filed March 11,\\n2013). The Tax Court issued its opinion in 3M Co.’s case (“3M Co. opinion”) on February 9, 2023. Once the Tax Court completes its analysis of the application of the 3M Co.\\nopinion to the Company’s case, the Company expects the Tax Court to render another opinion, and ultimately a final decision, in the Company’s case.\\nThe Company believes that the IRS and the Tax Court misinterpreted and misapplied the applicable regulations in reallocating income earned by the Company’s foreign\\nlicensees to increase the Company’s U.S. tax. Moreover, the Company believes that the retroactive imposition of such tax liability using a calculation methodology different\\nfrom that previously agreed upon by the IRS and the Company, and audited by the IRS for over a decade, is unconstitutional. The Company intends to assert its claims on\\nappeal and vigorously defend its position.\\nIn determining the amount of tax reserve to be recorded as of December 31, 2020, the Company completed the required two-step evaluation process prescribed by Accounting\\nStandards Codification 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. In doing so, we consulted with outside advisors, and we reviewed and considered relevant laws, rules, and\\nregulations, including, but not limited to, the Opinion and relevant caselaw. We also considered our intention to vigorously defend our positions and assert our various well-\\nfounded legal claims via every available avenue of appeal. We concluded, based on the technical and legal merits of the Company’s tax positions, that it is more likely than not\\nthe Company’s tax positions will ultimately be sustained on appeal. In addition, we considered a number of alternative transfer pricing methodologies, including the\\nmethodology asserted by the IRS and affirmed in the Opinion (“Tax Court Methodology”), that could be applied by the courts upon final resolution of the litigation. Based on\\nthe required probability analysis, we determined the methodologies we believe the federal courts could ultimately order to be used in calculating the Company’s tax. As a result\\nof this analysis, we recorded a tax reserve of $438\\xa0million during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the application of the resulting methodologies as well as the\\ndifferent tax treatment applicable to dividends originally paid to the U.S. parent company by its foreign licensees, in reliance upon the Closing Agreement, that would be\\nrecharacterized as royalties in accordance with the Opinion and the Company’s analysis.\\nThe Company’s conclusion that it is more likely than not the Company’s tax positions will ultimately be sustained on appeal is unchanged as of December\\xa031, 2022. However,\\nwe updated our calculation of the methodologies we believe the federal courts\\n28\\ncould ultimately order to be used in calculating the Company’s tax. As a result of the application of the required probability analysis to these updated calculations and the\\naccrual of interest through the current reporting period, we updated our tax reserve as of December\\xa031, 2022 to $423\\xa0million.\\nWhile the Company strongly disagrees with the IRS’ positions and the portions of the Opinion affirming such positions, it is possible that some portion or all of the adjustment\\nproposed by the IRS and sustained by the Tax Court could ultimately be upheld. In that event, the Company would likely be subject to significant additional liabilities for tax\\nyears 2007 through 2009, and potentially also for subsequent years, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, and\\ncash flows.\\nThe Company calculated the potential impact of applying the Tax Court Methodology to reallocate income from foreign licensees potentially covered within the scope of the\\nOpinion, assuming such methodology were to be ultimately upheld by the courts, and the IRS were to decide to apply that methodology to subsequent years, with consent of the\\nfederal courts. This impact would include taxes and interest accrued through December 31, 2022 for the 2007 through 2009 litigated tax years and for subsequent tax years from\\n2010 through 2022. The calculations incorporated the estimated impact of correlative adjustments to the previously accrued transition tax payable under the Tax Reform Act.\\nThe Company estimates that the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability could be approximately $14 billion as of December 31, 2022. Additional income tax\\nand interest would continue to accrue until the time any such potential liability, or portion thereof, were to be paid. We currently project the continued application of the Tax\\nCourt Methodology in future years, assuming similar facts and circumstances as of December\\xa031, 2022, would result in an incremental annual tax liability that would increase\\nthe Company’s effective tax rate by approximately 3.5 percent.\\nThe Company does not know when the Tax Court will issue its opinion regarding the effect of Brazilian legal restrictions on the payment of royalties by the Company’s licensee\\nin Brazil for the 2007 through 2009 tax years. After the Tax Court issues its opinion on the Company’s Brazilian licensee, the Company and the IRS will be provided time to\\nagree on the tax impact, if any, of both opinions, after which the Tax Court would render a final decision in the case. The Company will have 90 days thereafter to file a notice\\nof appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit and pay the tax liability and interest related to the 2007 through 2009 tax years. The Company currently\\nestimates that the payment to be made at that time related to the 2007 through 2009 tax years, which is included in the above estimate of the potential aggregate incremental tax\\nand interest liability, would be approximately $5.2 billion (including interest accrued through December 31, 2022), plus any additional interest accrued through the time of\\npayment. Some or all of this amount would be refunded if the Company were to prevail on appeal.\\nITEM 4.\\xa0\\xa0MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\\nNot applicable.\\nITEM X.\\xa0\\xa0INFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\\nThe following are the executive officers of our Company as of February\\xa021, 2023:\\nName\\nAge\\nPosition\\nManuel Arroyo\\n55\\nChief Marketing Officer since January 2020 and, prior to that, President of the Asia Pacific Group from January 2019 to\\nDecember 2020.

We own or license and market numerous beverage brands, which we group into the following categories: Trademark Coca-Cola; sparkling flavors;\\nwater, sports, coffee and tea; juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages; and emerging beverages. We own and market five of the world’s top six nonalcoholic\\nsparkling soft drink brands: Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and Diet Coke/Coca-Cola Light.\\nWe make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of independent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and\\nretailers as well as the Company’s consolidated bottling and distribution operations. Beverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to us account for 2.2 billion of the\\nestimated 64\\xa0billion servings of all beverages consumed worldwide every day.\\nWe believe our success depends on our ability to connect with consumers by providing them with a wide variety of beverage options to meet their desires, needs and lifestyles.\\nOur success further depends on the ability of our people to execute effectively, every day.\\nOur Company markets, manufactures and sells:\\n• beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as “beverage bases,” and syrups, including fountain syrups (we refer to this part of our business as our “concentrate\\noperations”); and\\n• finished sparkling soft drinks and other beverages (we refer to this part of our business as our “finished product operations”).\\nGenerally, finished product operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations.\\nOur concentrate operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates, syrups and certain finished beverages to authorized bottling operations (to which\\nwe typically refer as our “bottlers” or our “bottling partners”). Our bottling partners either combine concentrates with still or sparkling water and sweeteners (depending on the\\nproduct), or combine syrups with still or sparkling water, to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers, such as cans and\\nrefillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles, bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us\\xa0and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, through\\nwholesalers or other bottlers. In addition, outside the\\n33\\nUnited States, our bottling partners are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, using our concentrates, which they sell to fountain retailers for use in producing\\nbeverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. Our concentrate operations\\nare included in our geographic operating segments and our Global Ventures operating segment.\\nOur finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling soft drinks and a variety of other finished beverages to retailers, or to distributors and\\nwholesalers who in turn sell the beverages to retailers. These operations consist primarily of our consolidated bottling and distribution operations, which are included in our\\nBottling Investments operating segment. In certain markets, the Company also operates non-bottling finished product operations in which we sell finished beverages to\\ndistributors and wholesalers that are generally not one of the Company’s bottling partners. These operations are generally included in one of our geographic operating segments\\nor our Global Ventures operating segment. Additionally, we sell directly to consumers through retail stores operated by Costa. These sales are included in our Global Ventures\\noperating segment. In the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers, who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate\\nconsumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who in turn sell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. These fountain syrup sales are included in our\\nNorth America operating segment.\\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of total net operating revenues attributable to concentrate operations and finished product operations:\\nYear Ended December\\xa031,\\n2022\\n2021\\nConcentrate operations\\n56\\xa0%\\n56\\xa0%\\nFinished product operations\\n44\\xa0\\n44\\xa0\\nTotal\\n100\\xa0%\\n100\\xa0%\\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of total worldwide unit case volume attributable to concentrate operations and finished product operations:\\nYear Ended December\\xa031,\\n2022\\n2021\\nConcentrate operations\\n82\\xa0%\\n83\\xa0%\\nFinished product operations\\n18\\xa0\\n17\\xa0\\nTotal\\n100\\xa0%\\n100\\xa0%\\nWe operate in the highly competitive commercial beverage industry. We face strong competition from numerous other general and specialty beverage companies. We, along\\nwith other beverage companies, are affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the cost to manufacture and distribute products, consumer spending, economic\\nconditions, availability and quality of water, consumer preferences, inflation, geopolitical conditions, local and national laws and regulations, foreign currency exchange rate\\nfluctuations, fuel prices, weather patterns and the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nOn March 8, 2022, the Company announced the suspension of its business in Russia as a result of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. In addition, the conflict has caused\\na disruption of our business in Ukraine. The Company will continue to monitor and assess the situation as circumstances evolve. As a point of reference, in 2021, the\\nCompany’s business in Russia and Ukraine contributed 2 percent of the Company’s unit case volume and 1 percent and 2 percent of the Company’s consolidated net operating\\nrevenues and operating income, respectively.\\nThroughout 2022, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the resurgence of the virus in certain countries and the related actions by governments to attempt to contain\\nthe spread of the virus, continued to negatively impact our business. While uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic remain, and factors such as the state of the supply\\nchain, labor shortages and the inflationary environment are likely to impact the pace of the economic recovery, we are focused on executing for growth.\\nDespite the dynamic world in which we are currently operating, we believe we are well positioned to create value for our Company and our stakeholders. In an effort to support\\nour future growth, we are continuing to invest in our portfolio of brands, our strategic capabilities and our people. We are focused on the following strategic priorities:\\nunlocking the potential of our portfolio of strong global, regional and scaled local brands; developing a robust innovation pipeline focusing on scalable initiatives; increasing\\nconsumer-centric marketing effectiveness and efficiency; winning in the marketplace with aligned data-driven revenue growth management and execution capabilities; and\\nfurther embedding sustainability goals into our operations.\\n34\\nChallenges and Risks\\nBeing a global enterprise provides unique opportunities for our Company. Challenges and risks accompany those opportunities. Our management has identified certain\\nchallenges and risks that demand the attention of our Company and the commercial beverage industry. Of these, five key challenges and risks are discussed below.\\nObesity\\nObesity continues to impact communities and countries worldwide. There is growing concern among consumers, public health professionals and governments about the health\\nproblems associated with obesity. This concern represents a significant challenge to our industry. We understand that obesity is a complex public health challenge, and we are\\ncommitted to being a part of the solution.\\nWe recognize the uniqueness of consumers’ lifestyles and dietary choices. Therefore, we continue to:\\n• offer an expanded portfolio of beverage choices, including reduced-, low- and no-calorie beverage options;\\n• provide transparent nutrition information, featuring calories on the front of most of our packages;\\n• provide our beverages in a range of packaging sizes, including small sizes to enable portion control; and\\n• market responsibly, including no advertising targeted to children under 13.\\nThe heritage of our Company is to lead, and innovation is critical for leadership. As such, we are resolute in continuing to innovate and are committed to partnering to find\\nwinning solutions in the area of noncaloric sweeteners. This includes working to reduce sugar and calories in many of our beverages. We want to be a helpful and credible\\npartner in the fight against obesity. Across the Coca-Cola system, we are mobilizing our assets in marketing and in community outreach to increase awareness and spur action.\\nEvolving Consumer Product Preferences\\nWe are impacted by shifting consumer demographics and needs, on-the-go lifestyles and consumers who are empowered with more information than ever. As a consequence of\\nthese changes, many consumers want more beverage choices, personalization, a focus on sustainability, and transparency related to our products and packaging. We are\\ncommitted to meeting changing consumer needs and to generating growth through our evolving portfolio of beverage brands and products (including numerous low- and no-\\ncalorie products); selectively expanding into other profitable categories of the commercial beverage industry; innovative and sustainable packaging; and ingredient education\\nefforts.\\nEvolving Competitive Landscape and Competing in the Digital Marketplace\\nOur Company faces strong competition from well-established global companies as well as numerous regional and local companies. Additionally, the rapidly evolving digital\\nlandscape and growth of e-commerce in many markets has led to dramatic shifts in consumer shopping habits and patterns. Consumers are rapidly embracing shopping via\\nmobile device applications, e-commerce retailers and e-commerce websites or platforms, which presents new challenges to maintain the competitiveness and relevancy of our\\nbrands. As a result, we must continuously strengthen our capabilities in marketing and innovation to compete in a digital environment and maintain brand loyalty and market\\nshare. In addition, we are increasing our investments in e-commerce to support retail and meal delivery services, offering more package sizes that are fit-for-purpose for online\\nsales, and shifting more consumer and trade promotions to digital.\\nProduct Safety and Quality\\nWe strive to meet the highest standards in both product safety and product quality. We are aware that some consumers have concerns and negative viewpoints regarding certain\\ningredients used in our products. The Coca-Cola system works every day to produce high quality, safe and refreshing beverages for consumers around the world. We have\\nrigorous product and ingredient safety and quality standards designed to ensure safety and quality in each of our products, and we drive innovation that provides new beverage\\noptions to satisfy consumers’ evolving needs and preferences.\\nWe work to ensure consistent safety and quality through strong governance and compliance with applicable regulations and standards. We stay current with new regulations,\\nindustry best practices and marketplace conditions, and we engage with standard-setting and industry organizations. Additionally, we manufacture and distribute our products\\naccording to strict policies, requirements and specifications set forth in an integrated quality management program that continually measures all operations within the Coca-\\nCola system against the same stringent standards. Our quality management program also identifies and mitigates risks and drives improvement. In our quality laboratories, we\\nstringently measure the quality attributes of ingredients as well as samples of finished products collected from the marketplace.\\n35\\nWe perform due diligence to ensure that product and ingredient safety and quality standards are maintained in the more than 200 countries and territories where our products are\\nsold. We regularly assess the relevance of our requirements and standards and continually work to improve and refine them across our entire supply chain.\\nSustainability Matters\\nAs investors and stakeholders increasingly focus on sustainability matters, our Company and companies across all industries are facing challenges and risks related to, among\\nother things, sustainable packaging; water stewardship; climate; health and nutrition; human rights; and diversity, equity and inclusion. Where these challenges and risks relate\\nto our business, we acknowledge that we have a role to play in developing and implementing solutions related to these important challenges. We have established specific\\nsustainability focus areas: water quality and scarcity; packaging materials used for our products; reduction of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions; sustainable\\nsourcing of agricultural commodities; diversity, equity and inclusion; and human and workplace rights. Our ability to achieve our sustainability goals is dependent on many\\nfactors, including, but not limited to, our actions along with the actions of various stakeholders, such as our bottling partners, suppliers, governments, nongovernmental\\norganizations, communities, and other third parties, all of which are outside of our control.\\nSee “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in Part I of this report for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company.\\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”), which require\\nmanagement to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We believe our\\nmost critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following:\\n• Principles of Consolidation\\n• Recoverability of Current and Noncurrent Assets\\n• Pension Plan Valuations\\n• Revenue Recognition\\n• Income Taxes\\nManagement has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Company’s Board of\\nDirectors. While our estimates and assumptions are based on our knowledge of current events and on actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately\\ndiffer from these estimates and assumptions. For a discussion of the Company’s significant accounting policies, refer to Note\\xa01 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\\nPrinciples of Consolidation\\nOur Company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest. Additionally, there are situations in which consolidation is required even\\nthough the usual condition of consolidation (i.e., ownership of a majority voting interest) does not apply. Generally, this occurs when an entity holds an interest in another\\nbusiness enterprise that was achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests, which results in a disproportionate relationship between such entity’s voting\\ninterests in, and its exposure to the economic risks and potential rewards of, the other business enterprise. This disproportionate relationship results in what is known as a\\nvariable interest, and the entity in which another entity holds a variable interest is referred to as a “VIE.” An enterprise must consolidate a VIE if it is determined to be the\\nprimary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary has both (1)\\xa0the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic\\nperformance and (2)\\xa0the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\\nOur Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling operations, for which we were not determined to be the primary beneficiary. Our variable interests in these\\nVIEs primarily relate to equity investments, profit guarantees or subordinated financial support. Refer to Note\\xa011 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Although these\\nfinancial arrangements resulted in our holding variable interests in these entities, they did not empower us to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the\\nVIEs’ economic performance. Creditors of our VIEs do not have recourse against the general credit of the Company, regardless of whether the VIEs are accounted for as\\nconsolidated entities.\\nWe use the equity method to account for investments in companies if our investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and\\nfinancial policies of the investee. Our consolidated net income includes our\\n36\\nCompany’s proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies. Our judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investee includes\\nconsidering key factors, such as our ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intercompany\\ntransactions.\\nWe eliminate from our financial results all significant intercompany transactions, including the intercompany transactions with consolidated VIEs and the intercompany portion\\nof transactions with equity method investees.\\nRecoverability of Current and Noncurrent Assets\\nOur Company faces many uncertainties and risks related to various economic, political and regulatory environments in the countries and territories in which we operate,\\nparticularly in developing and emerging markets. Refer to the heading “Our Business\\xa0— Challenges and Risks” above and “Item\\xa01A. Risk Factors” in Part\\xa0I of this report. As a\\nresult, management must make numerous assumptions, which involve a significant amount of judgment, when performing recoverability and impairment tests of current and\\nnoncurrent assets in various regions around the world.\\nWe perform recoverability and impairment tests of current and noncurrent assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For certain assets, recoverability and/or impairment tests are\\nrequired only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For other assets, impairment tests are required at least annually, or more frequently\\nif events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired.\\nThe performance of recoverability and impairment tests of current and noncurrent assets involves critical accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management\\njudgment, include inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation. Factors that management must estimate include, among others,\\nthe economic lives of the assets, sales volume, pricing, royalty rates, cost of raw materials, delivery costs, the impact of any supply chain disruptions, inflation, long-term\\ngrowth rates, cost of capital, marketing spending, foreign currency exchange rates, tax rates, capital spending, proceeds from the sale of assets and customers’ financial\\ncondition. The variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period. These factors are even more\\ndifficult to estimate as a result of uncertainties associated with the scope, severity and duration of the global COVID-19 pandemic. The estimates we use when performing\\nrecoverability tests of assets are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. When performing impairment tests, we estimate the fair values of the assets using\\nmanagement’s best assumptions, which we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use. The Company has certain intangible and other long-lived assets\\nthat are more dependent on cash flows generated in away-from-home channels and/or that generate cash flows in geographic areas which are more heavily impacted by the\\nCOVID-19 pandemic, and therefore these assets are more susceptible to impairment. In addition, intangible and other long-lived assets we acquired in recent transactions are\\nnaturally more susceptible to impairment, because they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and macroeconomic conditions at the time of acquisition. If\\nwe had used other assumptions and estimates when impairment tests were performed, impairment charges could have resulted. Furthermore, if management uses different\\nassumptions in future periods, or if different conditions exist in future periods, impairment charges could result. The total future impairment charges we may be required to\\nrecord could be material. Refer to Note\\xa02 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent acquisitions. Refer to Note\\xa016 of Notes to Consolidated\\nFinancial Statements for the discussion of impairment charges. Refer to the heading “Operations Review” below for additional information related to our present business\\nenvironment.\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2022, the carrying value of our investment in Coca-Cola Bottlers Japan Holdings Inc. (“CCBJHI”) exceeded its fair value by $29 million, or 8 percent.\\nBased on the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than our carrying value and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time\\nsufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value, management determined that the decline in fair value was temporary in nature. Therefore, we did not record an\\nimpairment charge related to the investment.\\nOur equity method investees also perform such recoverability and impairment tests. If an impairment charge is recorded by one of our equity method investees, the Company\\nrecords its proportionate share of such charge as a reduction of equity income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income. However, the actual amount we record with\\nrespect to our proportionate share of such charge may be impacted by items such as basis differences, deferred taxes and deferred gains.\\nInvestments in Equity and Debt Securities\\nWe measure all equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value with the change in fair value included in\\nnet income. We use quoted market prices to determine the fair value of equity securities with readily determinable fair values. For equity securities without readily determinable\\nfair values, we have elected the measurement alternative under which we measure these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from\\nobservable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Management assesses each of these investments on an individual\\nbasis.\\n37\\nOur investments in debt securities are carried at either amortized cost or fair value. The cost basis is determined by the specific identification method. Investments in debt\\nsecurities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost and classified as held-to-maturity. Investments in debt securities\\nthat are not classified as held-to-maturity are carried at fair value and classified as either trading or available-for-sale. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading debt\\nsecurities as well as realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are included in net income. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on available-for-sale debt\\nsecurities are included in our consolidated balance sheet as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), except for the changes in fair values attributable to\\nthe currency risk being hedged, if applicable, which are included in net income.\\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity method and debt securities classified as trading are not assessed for\\nimpairment, since they are carried at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income. Equity method investments, equity securities without readily determinable\\nfair values and debt securities classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity are reviewed each reporting period to determine whether a significant event or change in\\ncircumstances has occurred that may have an adverse effect on the fair value of each investment. When such events or changes occur, we evaluate the fair value compared to\\nour cost basis in the investment. We also perform this evaluation every reporting period for each investment for which our cost basis has exceeded the fair value. The fair values\\nof most of our Company’s investments in publicly traded companies are often readily available based on quoted market prices. For investments in nonpublicly traded\\ncompanies, management’s assessment of fair value is based on various valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds, and appraisals, as\\nappropriate. We consider the assumptions that we believe a market participant would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or\\nestimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies. The ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in emerging and developing markets, may impact the\\ndetermination of fair value. In the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other\\nthan temporary. If management determines the decline is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. Management’s assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair\\nvalue is based on, among other things, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis; the financial condition and near-term\\nprospects of the issuer; and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.\\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\\nCertain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount or remaining useful life of property, plant and equipment should be\\nassessed, including, among others, the manner or length of time in which the Company intends to use the asset, a significant decrease in market value, a significant change in\\nthe business climate in a particular market, or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses and/or projected future losses. When such events or\\nchanges in circumstances are present and a recoverability test is performed, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its\\neventual disposition. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and\\nwithout interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment charge. The impairment charge recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount\\nexceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of property, plant and equipment, including appraisals and discounted cash flow models.\\nThese appraisals and models include assumptions we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use.\\nGoodwill, Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets\\nIntangible assets are classified into three categories: (1)\\xa0intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization; (2)\\xa0intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to\\namortization; and (3)\\xa0goodwill. For intangible assets with definite lives, recoverability tests must be performed if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be\\nrecoverable. For intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill, impairment tests must be performed at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances\\nindicate that an asset may be impaired.\\nThe performance of recoverability and impairment tests of intangible assets involves critical accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management judgment,\\ninclude inherent uncertainties and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation. Factors that management must estimate include, among others, the\\neconomic lives of the assets, sales volume, pricing, royalty rates, cost of raw materials, delivery costs, the impact of any supply chain disruptions, inflation, long-term growth\\nrates, cost of capital, marketing spending, foreign currency exchange rates, tax rates, capital spending, proceeds from the sale of assets and customers’ financial condition.\\nThese factors are even more difficult to predict when global financial markets are highly volatile. The estimates we use when performing recoverability tests of intangible assets\\nare consistent with those we use in our internal planning. When performing impairment tests, we estimate the fair values of the assets using management’s best assumptions,\\nwhich we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use. The estimates and assumptions used in these tests are evaluated and updated as appropriate. The\\nvariability of these factors depends on a number\\n38\\nof conditions, including uncertainty about future events, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period. If other assumptions and estimates had been used\\nwhen these tests were performed, impairment charges could have resulted. As mentioned above, these factors do not change in isolation and, therefore, we do not believe it is\\npracticable or meaningful to present the impact of changing a single factor. Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions in future periods or if different conditions\\nexist in future periods, impairment charges could result. Refer to the heading “Operations Review” below for additional information related to our present business\\nenvironment.\\nIntangible assets acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment, because they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and\\nmacroeconomic conditions present at the time of acquisition. Consequently, if operating results and/or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate shortly after an acquisition, it\\ncould result in the impairment of the acquired assets. A deterioration of macroeconomic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in\\nour cash flow models but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses, including, but not limited to, the estimated cost of capital and/or discount rates.\\nAdditionally, we are required to ensure that the assumptions used to determine fair value in our analyses are consistent with the assumptions that we believe a market\\nparticipant would use. As a result, the cost of capital and/or discount rates used in our analyses may increase or decrease based on market conditions and trends, regardless of\\nwhether our Company’s actual cost of capital has changed. Therefore, if the cost of capital and/or discount rates change, our Company may recognize an impairment of an\\nintangible asset in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are equal to, or greater than, our previously forecasted amounts.\\nWe perform impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level, which is generally one level below our operating segments. Our operating segments are primarily based on\\ngeographic responsibility, which is consistent with the way management runs our business. Our geographic operating segments are generally subdivided into smaller\\ngeographic regions. These geographic regions are our reporting units. Our Global Ventures operating segment includes the results of our Costa, innocent and doğadan\\nbusinesses, as well as fees earned pursuant to distribution coordination agreements between the Company and Monster, each of which is its own reporting unit. The Bottling\\nInvestments operating segment includes all of our consolidated bottling operations, regardless of geographic location. Generally, each consolidated bottling operation within\\nour Bottling Investments operating segment is its own reporting unit. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or units that benefit from the synergies arising from each\\nbusiness combination.\\nIn order to test for goodwill impairment, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting\\nunit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is written down for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. However, the impairment\\ncharge recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. We typically use discounted cash flow models to determine the fair value of a reporting unit. The\\nassumptions used in these models are consistent with those we believe a market participant would use. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of\\ngoodwill rather than completing the impairment test. The Company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying\\namount. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing discussed above. Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any further\\nassessment.\\nWhen events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of definite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable, management performs a recoverability test of the\\ncarrying value by preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting gross profit and cash flows. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our\\ninternal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, we\\nrecognize an impairment charge. The impairment charge recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to\\ndetermine the fair value of these assets, including discounted cash flow models. These models include assumptions we believe are consistent with those a market participant\\nwould use.\\nWe test indefinite-lived intangible assets, including trademarks, franchise rights and goodwill, for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate\\nthat an asset may be impaired. Our Company performs these annual impairment tests as of the first day of our third fiscal quarter. We use a variety of methodologies in\\nconducting impairment tests of indefinite-lived intangible assets, including, but not limited to, discounted cash flow models. These models include assumptions we believe are\\nconsistent with those a market participant would use. For indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment\\ncharge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than\\ngoodwill, rather than completing the impairment test. The Company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its\\ncarrying amount. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing described above. Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any\\nfurther assessment.\\n39\\nPension Plan Valuations\\nOur Company sponsors a qualified pension plan covering substantially all U.S. employees as well as unfunded nonqualified pension plans for certain employees in the United\\nStates. In addition, our Company and its subsidiaries have various pension plans outside the United States.\\nManagement is required to make certain critical estimates related to the actuarial assumptions used to determine our pension obligations and our net periodic pension cost or\\nincome. We believe the two most critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Our actuarial assumptions are reviewed\\nannually, or more frequently to the extent that a settlement or curtailment occurs. Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our\\npension obligations and our net periodic pension cost or income.\\nThe discount rate assumption used to account for pension plans reflects the rate at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled. The discount rate for U.S. and\\ncertain non-U.S. plans is determined using a matching technique whereby the rates of a yield curve, developed from high-quality debt securities, are applied to projected benefit\\ncash flows to determine the appropriate effective discount rate. For other non-U.S. plans, we base the discount rate assumption on comparable indices within each of the\\nrespective countries. The Company measures the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost or income by applying the specific spot rates along the\\nyield curve to the plans’ projected cash flows.\\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based upon the long-term outlook of our investment strategy as well as our historical returns and volatilities for each\\nasset class. We also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Our investment\\nobjective for our pension assets is to ensure all funded pension plans have sufficient assets to meet their benefit obligations when they become due. As a result, the Company\\nperiodically revises asset allocations, where appropriate, to seek to improve returns and manage risk.\\nIn 2022, the Company’s net periodic pension income was $124 million. In 2023, we expect our net periodic pension cost to be approximately $40\\xa0million. The primary driver of\\nthis change is the unfavorable performance of plan assets in 2022, partially offset by the net impact of the increase in the weighted-average discount rate at December\\xa031, 2022\\ncompared to December\\xa031, 2021.\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2022, the U.S. qualified pension plan represented 64 percent and 61 percent of the Company’s consolidated projected benefit obligation and pension plan\\nassets, respectively. For this plan, we estimate that a 50 basis-point decrease in the discount rate would result in a $13\\xa0million increase in our 2023 net periodic pension cost,\\nand we estimate that a 50 basis-point decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would result in a $21\\xa0million increase in our 2023 net periodic pension\\ncost.\\nRefer to Note\\xa013 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our pension plans and related actuarial assumptions.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nRevenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contracts with our customers are satisfied. Our performance obligation generally consists of the\\npromise to sell concentrates, syrups or finished products to our bottling partners, wholesalers, distributors or retailers. Control of the concentrates, syrups or finished products is\\ntransferred upon shipment to, or receipt at, our customers’ locations, as determined by the specific terms of the contract. Upon transfer of control to the customer, which\\ncompletes our performance obligation, revenue is recognized. Our sales terms generally do not allow for a right of return except for matters related to any manufacturing\\ndefects on our part. After completion of our performance obligation, we have an unconditional right to consideration as outlined in the contract. Our receivables will generally\\nbe collected in less than six months, in accordance with the underlying payment terms. All of our performance obligations under the terms of contracts with our customers have\\nan original duration of one year or less.\\nOur customers and bottling partners may be entitled to cash discounts, funds for promotional and marketing activities, volume‑based incentive programs, support for\\ninfrastructure programs, and other similar programs. In most markets, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value,\\naligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers’ always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing\\nmodel. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished\\nproducts produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix. The amounts associated with the arrangements described above represent variable consideration, an\\nestimate of which is included in the transaction price as a component of net operating revenues in our consolidated statement of income upon completion of our performance\\nobligations. The total revenue recorded, including any variable consideration, cannot exceed the amount for which it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur when\\nuncertainties related to variability are resolved. As a result, we are recognizing revenue based on our faithful depiction of the consideration that we expect to receive. In making\\n40\\nour estimates of variable consideration, we consider past results and make significant assumptions related to: (1) customer sales volumes; (2) customer ending inventories; (3)\\ncustomer selling price per unit; (4) selling channels; and (5) discount rates, rebates and other pricing allowances, as applicable. In gathering data to estimate our variable\\nconsideration, we generally calculate our estimates using a portfolio approach at the country and product line level rather than at the individual contract level. The result of\\nmaking these estimates will impact the line items trade accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet. The actual amounts\\nultimately paid and/or received may be different from our estimates.\\nIncome Taxes\\nOur annual effective tax rate is based on our income and the tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our\\nannual income tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we\\ndetermine that the position becomes uncertain based upon one of the following conditions: (1)\\xa0the tax position is not “more likely than not” to be sustained; (2)\\xa0the tax position\\nis “more likely than not” to be sustained, but for a lesser amount; or (3)\\xa0the tax position is “more likely than not” to be sustained, but not in the financial period in which the tax\\nposition was originally taken. For purposes of evaluating whether or not a tax position is uncertain, (1)\\xa0we presume the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing\\nauthority that has full knowledge of all relevant information; (2)\\xa0the technical merits of a tax position are derived from authorities such as legislation and statutes, legislative\\nintent, regulations, rulings and caselaw and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position; and (3)\\xa0each tax position is evaluated without consideration of\\nthe possibility of offset or aggregation with other tax positions taken. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing\\nfacts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. Refer to the heading “Operations Review — Income Taxes” below and Note\\xa014 of Notes to Consolidated Financial\\nStatements.\\nA number of years may elapse before a particular uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved. The number of years subject to tax audits or tax assessments varies\\ndepending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the “more likely than not” recognition threshold would be\\nrecognized in income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears under any one of the following conditions: (1)\\xa0the tax position is “more likely than\\nnot” to be sustained; (2)\\xa0the tax position, amount and/or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation; or (3)\\xa0the statute of limitations for the tax position has\\nexpired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. Refer to Note\\xa011 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\\nTax laws require certain items to be included in the tax return at different times than when these items are reflected in the consolidated financial statements. As a result, the\\nannual effective tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different from that reported in our tax return (our cash tax rate). Some of these differences are\\npermanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. Deferred tax assets and liabilities\\nare determined based on temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The tax rates used to determine deferred tax assets or liabilities are\\nthe enacted tax rates in effect for the year and for the manner in which the differences are expected to reverse. Based on the evaluation of all available information, the\\nCompany recognizes future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered more likely than not.\\nWe evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing our forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future\\noperating results; the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences; taxable income in prior carryback years (if permitted); and the availability of tax planning strategies. A\\nvaluation allowance is required to be established unless management determines that it is more likely than not that the Company will ultimately realize the tax benefit\\nassociated with a deferred tax asset.\\nThe Company does not record a U.S. deferred tax liability for the excess of the book basis over the tax basis of its investments in foreign subsidiaries to the extent that the basis\\ndifference meets the indefinite reversal criteria. These criteria are met if the foreign subsidiary has invested, or will invest, the undistributed earnings indefinitely. The decision\\nas to the amount of undistributed earnings that the Company intends to maintain in non-U.S. subsidiaries takes into account various items, including, but not limited to,\\nforecasts and budgets of financial needs of cash for working capital, liquidity plans, capital improvement programs, merger and acquisition plans, and planned loans to other\\nnon-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company also evaluates its expected cash requirements in the United States. Other factors that can influence that determination are local restrictions\\non remittances (for example, in some countries a central bank application and approval are required in order for the Company’s local country subsidiary to pay a dividend),\\neconomic stability and asset risk. Refer to Note\\xa014 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\\n41\\nOPERATIONS REVIEW\\nOur organizational structure consists of the following operating segments: Europe, Middle East and Africa; Latin America; North America; Asia Pacific; Global Ventures; and\\nBottling Investments. Our operating structure also includes Corporate, which consists of a center and a platform services organization. For additional information regarding our\\noperating segments and Corporate, refer to Note\\xa019 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\\nStructural Changes, Acquired Brands and Newly Licensed Brands\\nIn order to continually improve upon the Company’s operating performance, from time to time, we engage in buying and selling ownership interests in bottling partners and\\nother manufacturing operations. In addition, we periodically acquire brands and their related operations or enter into license agreements for certain brands to supplement our\\nbeverage offerings. These items impact our operating results and certain key metrics used by management in assessing the Company’s performance.\\nUnit case volume growth is a key metric used by management to evaluate the Company’s performance because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. The\\nCompany’s unit case volume represents the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its\\nbottling partners to customers or consumers and, therefore, reflects unit case volume for both consolidated and unconsolidated bottlers. Refer to the heading “Beverage\\nVolume” below.\\nConcentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or\\nused in finished products sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. For Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, concentrate sales volume represents\\nthe amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents), sold by the Company to customers or consumers.\\nRefer to the heading “Beverage Volume” below.\\nWhen we analyze our net operating revenues, we generally consider the following factors: (1) volume growth (concentrate sales volume or unit case volume, as applicable); (2)\\nchanges in price, product and geographic mix; (3) foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and (4) acquisitions and divestitures (including structural changes as defined\\nbelow), as applicable. Refer to the heading “Net Operating Revenues” below. The Company sells concentrates and syrups to both consolidated and unconsolidated bottling\\npartners. The ownership structure of our bottling partners impacts the timing of recognizing concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume. When we sell concentrates or\\nsyrups to our consolidated bottling partners, we do not recognize the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume until the bottling partner has sold finished products\\nmanufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party. When we sell concentrates or syrups to our unconsolidated bottling partners, we recognize the concentrate\\nrevenue and concentrate sales volume when the concentrates or syrups are sold to the bottling partner. The subsequent sale of the finished products manufactured from the\\nconcentrates or syrups to a third party does not impact the timing of recognizing the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume. When we account for an unconsolidated\\nbottling partner as an equity method investment, we eliminate the intercompany profit related to concentrate sales to the extent of our ownership interest, until the equity\\nmethod investee has sold finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party. We typically report unit case volume when finished products\\nmanufactured from the concentrates or syrups are sold to a third party, regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any.\\nWe generally refer to acquisitions and divestitures of bottling operations as “structural changes,” which are a component of acquisitions and divestitures. Typically, structural\\nchanges do not impact the Company’s unit case volume or concentrate sales volume on a consolidated basis or at the geographic operating segment level. We recognize unit\\ncase volume for all sales of Company beverage products, regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any. However, the unit case volume reported by our\\nBottling Investments operating segment is generally impacted by structural changes because it only includes the unit case volume of our consolidated bottling operations. Refer\\nto Note\\xa02 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company’s acquisitions and divestitures.\\n“Acquired brands” refers to brands acquired during the past 12 months. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume\\nrelated to acquired brands in periods prior to the closing of a transaction. Therefore, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume related to an acquired brand are\\nincremental to prior year volume. We generally do not consider the acquisition of a brand to be a structural change.\\n“Licensed brands” refers to brands not owned by the Company but for which we hold certain rights, generally including, but not limited to, distribution rights, and from which\\nwe derive an economic benefit when the related products are sold. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to\\na licensed brand in periods prior to the beginning of the term of a license agreement. Therefore, in the year that a license agreement is entered into, the unit case volume and\\nconcentrate sales volume related to a licensed brand are incremental to prior year volume. We generally do not consider the licensing of a brand to be a structural change.\\n42\\nIn August 2022, the Company acquired a controlling interest in a bottling operation in Malawi. The impact of this acquisition has been included as a structural change in our\\nanalysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Bottling Investments and Europe, Middle East and Africa operating segments. Additionally, in\\nNovember 2022, the Company refranchised our bottling operations in Cambodia. The impact of this refranchising has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net\\noperating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Bottling Investments and Asia Pacific operating segments.\\nIn November 2021, the Company acquired the remaining ownership interest in BA Sports Nutrition, LLC (“BodyArmor”). The impact of this acquisition has been included in\\nacquisitions and divestitures in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the North America operating segment.\\nBeverage Volume\\nWe measure the volume of Company beverage products sold in two ways: (1) unit cases of finished products and (2)\\xa0concentrate sales. As used in this report, “unit case” means\\na unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eight-ounce servings), with the exception of unit case equivalents for Costa non-ready-to-drink\\nbeverage products, which are primarily measured in number of transactions; and “unit case volume” means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company\\nbeverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers. Unit case volume consists primarily of beverage products\\nbearing Company trademarks. Also included in unit case volume are certain brands licensed to, or distributed by, our Company, and brands owned by Coca-Cola system\\nbottlers for which our Company provides marketing support and from the sale of which we derive an economic benefit. In addition, unit case volume includes sales by certain\\njoint ventures in which the Company has an ownership interest. We believe unit case volume is one of the indicators of the underlying strength of the Coca-Cola system\\nbecause it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. The unit case volume numbers used in this report are derived based on estimates received by the Company\\nfrom its bottling partners and distributors. Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances\\nexpressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. For Costa non-ready-to-drink\\nbeverage products, concentrate sales volume represents the amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case\\nequivalents), sold by the Company to customers or consumers. Unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates are not necessarily equal during any given period.\\nFactors such as seasonality, bottlers’ inventory practices, supply point changes, timing of price increases, new product introductions and changes in product mix can create\\ndifferences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates. In addition to these items, the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in which\\nthe Company has an ownership interest, but to which the Company does not sell concentrates, syrups, source waters or powders/minerals, may give rise to differences between\\nunit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates.\\nInformation about our volume growth worldwide and by operating segment is as follows:\\nPercent Change 2022 versus 2021\\nUnit Cases\\nConcentrate Sales\\nWorldwide\\n5\\xa0%\\n5\\xa0%\\nEurope, Middle East\\xa0& Africa\\n3\\xa0%\\n2\\xa0%\\nLatin America\\n6\\xa0\\n7\\xa0\\nNorth America\\n2\\xa0\\n1\\xa0\\nAsia Pacific\\n6\\xa0\\n8\\xa0\\nGlobal Ventures\\n13\\xa0\\n13\\xa0\\nBottling Investments\\n12\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0N/A\\nBottling Investments operating segment data reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only.\\nGeographic and Global Ventures operating segment data reflect unit case volume growth for all bottlers, both consolidated and unconsolidated, and distributors in the applicable geographic areas.\\nGlobal Ventures operating segment data also reflects unit case volume growth for Costa retail stores.\\n1,2\\n1\\n2\\n43\\nUnit Case Volume\\nThe Coca-Cola system sold 32.7 billion and 31.3 billion unit cases of our products in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase was primarily a result of strength in away-from-\\nhome channels and ongoing investments in the marketplace.\\nUnit case volume in Europe, Middle East and Africa increased 3 percent, which included 4 percent growth in Trademark Coca-Cola, 6 percent growth in water, sports, coffee\\nand tea, and 2 percent growth in sparkling flavors, partially offset by a 13 percent decline in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages. The operating segment\\nreported growth in unit case volume of 8 percent in the Eurasia and Middle East operating unit and 1 percent in the Europe operating unit. Unit case volume in the Africa\\noperating unit was even. The growth in the Europe operating unit included the impact of the suspension of the Company’s business in Russia. The performance in the Africa\\noperating unit included the impact of transitioning certain territories to new franchise bottling partners.\\nIn Latin America, unit case volume increased 6 percent, which included 5 percent growth in Trademark Coca-Cola, 10 percent growth in water, sports, coffee and tea, 6 percent\\ngrowth in sparkling flavors and 10 percent growth in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages. The operating segment’s volume performance included 5 percent\\ngrowth in Mexico, 9 percent growth in Brazil and 11 percent growth in Argentina.\\nUnit case volume in North America increased 2 percent, which included 1 percent growth in Trademark Coca-Cola, 3 percent growth in both sparkling flavors and juice, value-\\nadded dairy and plant-based beverages, and even performance in water, sports, coffee and tea.\\nIn Asia Pacific, unit case volume increased 6 percent, which included 8 percent growth in sparkling flavors, 6 percent growth in Trademark Coca-Cola, 4 percent growth in\\nwater, sports, coffee and tea, and 9 percent growth in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages. The operating segment reported growth in unit case volume of 36\\npercent in the India and Southwest Asia operating unit, 6 percent in the ASEAN and South Pacific operating unit, and 2 percent in the Japan and South Korea operating unit,\\npartially offset by a decline of 3 percent in the Greater China and Mongolia operating unit.\\nUnit case volume for Global Ventures increased 13 percent, driven by 12 percent growth in water, sports, coffee and tea along with growth in energy drinks, partially offset by a\\ndecline of 3 percent in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages.\\nUnit case volume for Bottling Investments increased 12 percent, which primarily reflects growth in India, South Africa and Vietnam.\\nConcentrate Sales Volume\\nIn 2022, worldwide concentrate sales volume and unit case volume both grew 5 percent compared to 2021. The differences between concentrate sales volume and unit case\\nvolume growth rates for the operating segments were primarily due to the timing of concentrate shipments and the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in\\nwhich the Company has an ownership interest, but to which the Company does not sell concentrates, syrups, source waters or powders/minerals.\\n44\\nNet Operating Revenues\\nNet operating revenues were $43,004 million in 2022, compared to $38,655 million in 2021, an increase of $4,349\\xa0million, or 11 percent.\\nThe following table illustrates, on a percentage basis, the estimated impact of the factors resulting in the increase (decrease) in net operating revenues on a consolidated basis\\nand for each of our operating segments:\\nPercent Change 2022 versus 2021\\nVolume\\nPrice, Product &\\nGeographic Mix\\nForeign Currency\\nExchange Rate\\nFluctuations\\nAcquisitions &\\nDivestitures\\nTotal\\nConsolidated\\n5\\xa0%\\n11\\xa0%\\n(7)%\\n2\\xa0%\\n11\\xa0%\\nEurope, Middle East & Africa\\n2\\xa0%\\n16\\xa0%\\n(14)%\\n—\\xa0%\\n5\\xa0%\\nLatin America\\n7\\xa0\\n17\\xa0\\n(5)\\n—\\xa0\\n19\\xa0\\nNorth America\\n1\\xa0\\n12\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n6\\xa0\\n19\\xa0\\nAsia Pacific\\n8\\xa0\\n3\\xa0\\n(9)\\n—\\xa0\\n3\\xa0\\nGlobal Ventures\\n13\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n(11)\\n—\\xa0\\n1\\xa0\\nBottling Investments\\n12\\xa0\\n7\\xa0\\n(9)\\n—\\xa0\\n10\\xa0\\nNote: Certain rows may not add due to rounding.\\nRepresents the percent change in net operating revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in concentrate sales volume for our geographic operating segments and our Global Ventures\\noperating segment (expressed in unit case equivalents) after considering the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, if any. For our Bottling Investments operating segment, this represents the\\npercent change in net operating revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. Our Bottling Investments operating\\nsegment data reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. Refer to the heading “Beverage Volume” above.\\nIncludes structural changes, if any. Refer to the heading “Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and Newly Licensed Brands” above.\\nRefer to the heading “Beverage Volume” above for additional information related to changes in our unit case and concentrate sales volumes.\\n“Price, product and geographic mix” refers to the change in net operating revenues caused by factors such as price changes, the mix of products and packages sold, and the mix\\nof channels and geographic territories where the sales occurred. The impact of price, product and geographic mix is calculated by subtracting the change in net operating\\nrevenues resulting from volume increases or decreases, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and acquisitions and divestitures from the total change in net operating\\nrevenues. Management believes that providing investors with price, product and geographic mix enhances their understanding about the combined impact that the following\\nitems had on the Company’s net operating revenues: (1) pricing actions taken by the Company and, where applicable, our bottling partners; (2) changes in the mix of products\\nand packages sold; (3) changes in the mix of channels where products were sold; and (4) changes in the mix of geographic territories where products were sold. Management\\nuses this measure in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company’s performance.\\nPrice, product and geographic mix had an 11 percent favorable impact on our consolidated net operating revenues. Price, product and geographic mix was impacted by a variety\\nof factors and events, including, but not limited to, the following:\\n• Europe, Middle East and Africa — favorable pricing initiatives, including inflationary pricing in Türkiye, partially offset by unfavorable geographic mix;\\n• Latin America — favorable pricing initiatives, including inflationary pricing in Argentina, along with favorable channel and package mix;\\n• North America — favorable pricing initiatives, including a benefit resulting from the timing of price increases in the prior year, and favorable channel, package and\\nproduct mix;\\n• Asia Pacific — favorable pricing initiatives along with favorable channel and package mix, partially offset by unfavorable geographic mix;\\n• Global Ventures — favorable pricing initiatives and favorable channel mix, primarily due to the timing of Costa retail store reopenings in the United Kingdom in the\\nprior year, offset by the unfavorable impact of no longer receiving COVID-related incentives in the current year; and\\n• Bottling Investments — favorable pricing initiatives across most markets, partially offset by unfavorable geographic mix.\\n1\\n2\\n1\\n2\\n45\\nThe favorable channel and package mix for the year ended December\\xa031, 2022 in all applicable operating segments was primarily a result of strength in away-from-home\\nchannels in the current year and the impact of social distancing measures in the prior year.\\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our consolidated net operating revenues by 7 percent. This unfavorable impact was primarily due to a stronger U.S.\\ndollar compared to certain foreign currencies, including the Japanese yen, Turkish lira, euro, British pound sterling, Philippine peso, South African rand and Argentine peso,\\nwhich had an unfavorable impact on our Asia Pacific; Europe, Middle East and Africa; Global Ventures; Bottling Investments; and Latin America operating segments. The\\nunfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to the currencies listed above was partially offset by the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign\\ncurrencies, including the Brazilian real and Mexican peso, which had a favorable impact on our Latin America operating segment. Refer to the heading “Liquidity, Capital\\nResources and Financial Position\\xa0— Foreign Exchange” below for additional information about the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\\n“Acquisitions and divestitures” generally refers to acquisitions and divestitures of brands or businesses, some of which the Company considers to be structural changes. The\\nimpact of acquisitions and divestitures is the difference between the change in net operating revenues and the change in what our net operating revenues would have been if we\\nremoved the net operating revenues associated with an acquisition or a divestiture from either the current year or the prior year, as applicable. Management believes that\\nquantifying the impact that acquisitions and divestitures had on the Company’s net operating revenues provides investors with useful information to enhance their\\nunderstanding of the Company’s net operating revenue performance by improving their ability to compare our year-to-year results. Management considers the impact of\\nacquisitions and divestitures when evaluating the Company’s performance. Refer to the heading “Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and Newly Licensed Brands” above for\\nadditional information related to acquisitions and divestitures.\\nNet operating revenue growth rates are impacted by sales volume; price, product and geographic mix; foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and acquisitions and\\ndivestitures. The size and timing of acquisitions and divestitures are not consistent from period to period. Based on current spot rates and our hedging coverage in place, we\\nexpect foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will have an unfavorable impact on our full year 2023 net operating revenues.\\nInformation about our net operating revenues by operating segment and Corporate as a percentage of Company net operating revenues is as follows:\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2022\\n2021\\nEurope, Middle East\\xa0& Africa\\n16.0\\xa0%\\n17.0\\xa0%\\nLatin America\\n11.4\\xa0\\n10.7\\xa0\\nNorth America\\n36.5\\xa0\\n34.1\\xa0\\nAsia Pacific\\n11.0\\xa0\\n12.1\\xa0\\nGlobal Ventures\\n6.6\\xa0\\n7.3\\xa0\\nBottling Investments\\n18.3\\xa0\\n18.6\\xa0\\nCorporate\\n0.2\\xa0\\n0.2\\xa0\\nTotal\\n100.0\\xa0%\\n100.0\\xa0%\\nThe percentage contribution of each operating segment fluctuates over time due to net operating revenues in some operating segments growing at a faster rate compared to\\nother operating segments. In addition, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations impact the percentage contribution of each operating segment. For additional information\\nabout the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, refer to the heading “Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position\\xa0— Foreign Exchange” below.\\nGross Profit Margin\\nGross profit margin is a ratio calculated by dividing gross profit by net operating revenues. Management believes gross profit margin provides investors with useful information\\nrelated to the profitability of our business prior to considering all of the selling, general and administrative expenses and other operating charges incurred. Management uses\\nthis measure in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company’s performance.\\n46\\nOur gross profit margin decreased to 58.1 percent in 2022 from 60.3 percent in 2021. This decrease was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange\\nrate fluctuations, increased commodity and transportation costs, and the acquisition of BodyArmor, a finished goods business, in November 2021. The impact of these items\\nwas partially offset by favorable pricing initiatives as well as favorable channel and package mix. We expect commodity and transportation costs to continue to have an\\nunfavorable impact on our gross profit margin in 2023, and we will continue to proactively take actions in an effort to mitigate the impact of these incremental costs.\\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\\nThe following table sets forth the components of selling, general and administrative expenses (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2022\\n2021\\nSelling and distribution expenses\\n$\\n2,767\\xa0 $\\n2,574\\xa0\\nAdvertising expenses\\n4,319\\xa0\\n4,098\\xa0\\nStock-based compensation expense\\n356\\xa0\\n337\\xa0\\nOther operating expenses\\n5,438\\xa0\\n5,135\\xa0\\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\\n$\\n12,880\\xa0 $\\n12,144\\xa0\\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $736 million, or 6 percent, in 2022. This increase was primarily due to increased marketing spending, higher selling and\\ndistribution expenses, and higher annual incentive and stock-based compensation expense. The increase in selling and distribution expenses was due to the continued recovery\\nfrom the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase in stock-based compensation expense was primarily due to our strong financial performance in 2022 and a more favorable outlook\\nof our future financial performance, which resulted in higher payout assumptions as compared to 2021. In 2022, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased selling,\\ngeneral and administrative expenses by 6 percent.\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2022, we had $325 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock-based compensation awards granted under our plans, which\\nwe expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years as stock-based compensation expense. This expected cost does not include the impact of any future stock-\\nbased compensation awards. Refer to Note\\xa012 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\\nOther Operating Charges\\nOther operating charges incurred by operating segment and Corporate were as follows (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2022\\n2021\\nEurope, Middle East\\xa0& Africa\\n$\\n(7) $\\n141\\xa0\\nLatin America\\n—\\xa0\\n11\\xa0\\nNorth America\\n19\\xa0\\n39\\xa0\\nAsia Pacific\\n57\\xa0\\n12\\xa0\\nGlobal Ventures\\n—\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\nBottling Investments\\n—\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\nCorporate\\n1,146\\xa0\\n643\\xa0\\nTotal\\n$\\n1,215\\xa0 $\\n846\\xa0\\nIn 2022, the Company recorded other operating charges of\\xa0$1,215 million. These charges primarily consisted of $1,000 million related to the remeasurement of our contingent\\nconsideration liability to fair value in conjunction with our acquisition of fairlife, LLC (\"fairlife\") in 2020, $85 million related to the Company’s productivity and reinvestment\\nprogram and $57 million related to the impairment of a trademark in Asia Pacific. In addition, other operating charges included $38 million related to the restructuring of our\\nNorth America operating unit and $38 million related to the BodyArmor acquisition in 2021, which included various transition and transaction costs, employee retention costs\\nand the amortization of noncompete agreements, net of the reimbursement of distributor termination fees recorded in 2021. These charges were partially offset by a net gain of\\n$6\\xa0million due to revisions of management’s estimates related to the Company’s strategic realignment initiatives.\\nIn 2021, the Company recorded other operating charges of $846 million. These charges primarily consisted of $369 million related to the remeasurement of our contingent\\nconsideration liability to fair value in conjunction with the fairlife acquisition, $146 million related to the Company’s strategic realignment initiatives, $119 million related to\\nthe BodyArmor acquisition, which includes various transition and transaction costs, distributor termination fees, employee retention costs and the amortization of noncompete\\nagreements, and $115 million related to the Company’s productivity and reinvestment program. In\\n47\\naddition, other operating charges included an impairment charge of $78 million related to a trademark in Europe, which was driven by a change in the long-term outlook on the\\nlicensing arrangement for a certain brand, charges of $15 million related to tax litigation and a net charge of $4\\xa0million related to the restructuring of our manufacturing\\noperations in the United States.\\nRefer to Note\\xa02 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the BodyArmor and fairlife acquisitions.

The decrease in operating income was\\nprimarily driven by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 8 percent, increased marketing spending, increased operating expenses and higher other operating\\ncharges, partially offset by concentrate sales volume growth of 8 percent, favorable pricing initiatives, and favorable channel and package mix.\\nGlobal Ventures’ operating income for the years ended December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021 was $185 million and $293 million, respectively. The decrease in operating income was\\nprimarily driven by the impact of no longer receiving COVID-related incentives in the current year, higher commodity costs, higher selling and distribution expenses, and an\\nunfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 2 percent, partially offset by concentrate sales volume growth of 13 percent.\\nBottling Investments’ operating income for the years ended December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021 was $487 million and $473 million, respectively. The increase in operating income\\nwas primarily driven by unit case volume growth of 12 percent and favorable pricing initiatives, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 9\\npercent and higher selling and distribution expenses.\\nCorporate’s operating loss for the years ended December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021 was $2,636 million and $2,383 million, respectively. Operating loss in 2022 increased primarily as\\na result of higher other operating charges due to the remeasurement of our contingent consideration liability to fair value in conjunction with the fairlife acquisition and\\nincreased marketing spending.\\nInterest Income\\nInterest income was $449 million in 2022, compared to $276 million in 2021, an increase of $173 million, or 62 percent. This increase was primarily driven by higher returns in\\ncertain of our international locations.\\nInterest Expense\\nInterest expense was $882 million in 2022, compared to $1,597 million in 2021, a decrease of $715 million, or 45 percent. This decrease was primarily due to charges in 2021\\nof $650 million associated with the extinguishment of long-term debt and certain hedging activities that occurred during 2021, partially offset by the impact of higher interest\\nrates in 2022. Refer to Note\\xa010 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\\nEquity Income (Loss)\\xa0— Net\\nEquity income (loss)\\xa0— net represents our Company’s proportionate share of net income or loss from each of our equity method investees. In 2022, equity income was $1,472\\nmillion, compared to equity income of $1,438 million in 2021, an increase of $34\\xa0million, or 2 percent. The increase was primarily due to more favorable operating results\\nreported by several of our equity method investees in the current year, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact and the sale of all or a portion of\\nour ownership interest in certain equity method investees. In addition, the Company recorded net charges of $34\\xa0million and $13 million during the years ended December\\xa031,\\n2022 and 2021, respectively, which represent the Company’s proportionate share of significant operating and nonoperating items recorded by certain of our equity method\\ninvestees.\\n49\\nOther Income (Loss)\\xa0— Net\\nOther income (loss)\\xa0— net includes, among other things, dividend income; gains and losses related to the disposal of property, plant and equipment; gains and losses related to\\nacquisitions and divestitures; non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost or income for pension and other postretirement benefit plans; other charges and credits\\nrelated to pension and other postretirement benefit plans; realized and unrealized gains and losses on equity securities and trading debt securities; realized gains and losses on\\navailable-for-sale debt securities; other-than-temporary impairment charges; and net foreign currency exchange gains and losses. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses\\nare primarily the result of the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities from certain currencies into functional currencies. The effects of the remeasurement of these\\nassets and liabilities are partially offset by the impact of our economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note\\xa05 of Notes to\\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\\nIn 2022, other income (loss) — net was a loss of $262 million. The Company recorded a net loss of $371 million related to realized and unrealized gains and losses on equity\\nsecurities and trading debt securities as well as realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities, net foreign currency exchange losses of $236 million, an other-\\nthan-temporary impairment charge of $96 million related to an equity method investee in Russia, and a net loss of $24 million as a result of one of our equity method investees\\nissuing additional shares of its stock. Additionally, other income (loss) — net included net income of $219 million related to the non-service cost components of net periodic\\nbenefit income, a net gain of $153 million related to the refranchising of our bottling operations in Cambodia and dividend income of $111 million.\\nIn 2021, other income (loss) — net was income of $2,000 million. The Company recognized a gain of $834 million in conjunction with the BodyArmor acquisition; a net gain\\nof $695 million related to the sale of our ownership interest in Coca-Cola Amatil Limited (“CCA”), an equity method investee, to CCEP, also an equity method investee; and a\\nnet gain of $114\\xa0million related to the sale of our ownership interest in an equity method investee and the sale of a portion of our ownership interest in another equity method\\ninvestee. Additionally, the Company recognized a net gain of $467 million related to realized and unrealized gains and losses on equity securities and trading debt securities as\\nwell as realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities. Other income (loss) — net also included $277 million related to the non-service cost components of net\\nperiodic benefit income, dividend income of $73 million, charges of $266\\xa0million related to the restructuring of our manufacturing operations in the United States, pension plan\\nsettlement charges of $117\\xa0million related to our strategic realignment initiatives and net foreign currency exchange losses of $61\\xa0million.\\nRefer to Note\\xa02 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the acquisition of BodyArmor, the sale of our ownership interest in CCA and the\\nrefranchising of our bottling operations in Cambodia. Refer to Note\\xa04 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on equity and debt securities.\\nRefer to Note\\xa016 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the restructuring of our manufacturing operations in the United States and the\\nimpairment charges.

Refer to\\nNote\\xa019 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the impact these items had on our operating segments and Corporate.\\nIncome Taxes\\nOur effective tax rate reflects the tax benefits of having significant operations outside the United States, which are generally taxed at rates lower than the statutory U.S. federal\\ntax rate. As a result of employment actions and capital investments made by the Company, certain tax jurisdictions provide income tax incentive grants, including Brazil, Costa\\nRica, Singapore and Eswatini. The terms of these grants expire from 2025 to 2036. We anticipate that we will be able to extend or renew the grants in these locations. Tax\\nincentive grants favorably impacted our income tax expense by $406 million and $381 million for the years ended December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021, respectively. In addition, our\\neffective tax rate reflects the benefits of having significant earnings generated in investments accounted for under the equity method.\\n50\\nA reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal tax rate and our effective tax rate is as follows:\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2022\\n2021\\nStatutory U.S. federal tax rate\\n21.0\\xa0%\\n21.0\\xa0%\\nState and local income taxes\\xa0— net of federal benefit\\n1.4\\xa0\\n1.1\\xa0\\nEarnings in jurisdictions taxed at rates different from the statutory U.S. federal tax rate\\n(0.6)\\n2.3\\xa0\\nEquity income or loss\\n(2.7)\\n(2.0)\\nExcess tax benefits on stock-based compensation\\n(0.7)\\n(0.5)\\nOther\\xa0— net\\n(0.3)\\n(0.8)\\nEffective tax rate\\n18.1\\xa0%\\n21.1\\xa0%\\nIncludes net tax charges of $375 million (or a 3.0 percent impact on our effective tax rate) related to changes in tax laws in certain foreign jurisdictions, amounts required to be recorded for\\nchanges to our uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, in various international jurisdictions, as well as other discrete items.\\nIncludes a tax benefit of $14 million (or a 1.5 percent impact on our effective tax rate) associated with the $834\\xa0million gain recorded upon the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in\\nBodyArmor. Refer to Note\\xa02 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\\nOn November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued the Opinion regarding the Company’s 2015 litigation with the IRS involving transfer pricing tax adjustments in which the court\\npredominantly sided with the IRS. The Company disagrees with the Opinion and intends to vigorously defend its position. Refer to Note\\xa011 of Notes to Consolidated Financial\\nStatements.\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2022, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $926 million. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the net effect would\\nbe a benefit of $617 million, exclusive of any benefits related to interest and penalties. The remaining $309 million primarily represents tax benefits that would be received in\\ndifferent tax jurisdictions in the event the Company did not prevail on all uncertain tax positions.\\nA reconciliation of the changes in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2022\\n2021\\nBalance of unrecognized tax benefits at beginning of year\\n$\\n906\\xa0 $\\n915\\xa0\\nIncrease related to prior period tax positions\\n6\\xa0\\n9\\xa0\\nDecrease related to prior period tax positions\\n—\\xa0\\n(50)\\nIncrease related to current period tax positions\\n38\\xa0\\n37\\xa0\\nDecrease related to settlements with taxing authorities\\n(2)\\n(4)\\nEffect of foreign currency translation\\n(22)\\n(1)\\nBalance of unrecognized tax benefits at end of year\\n$\\n926\\xa0 $\\n906\\xa0\\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the line item income taxes in our consolidated statement of income. The Company had\\n$496 million and $453 million in interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Of these amounts, expense\\nof $43 million and $62 million was recognized in 2022 and 2021, respectively. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the reversal of this accrual would\\nbe a benefit to the Company’s effective tax rate.\\nBased on current tax laws, the Company’s effective tax rate in 2023 is expected to be approximately 19.5 percent before considering the potential impact of any significant\\noperating and nonoperating items that may affect our effective tax rate.\\nLIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND FINANCIAL POSITION\\nWe believe our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities is one of the fundamental strengths of our business. Refer to the heading “Cash Flows from Operating\\nActivities” below. The Company does not typically raise capital through the issuance of stock. Instead, we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital and increase\\nour return on shareowners’ equity. Refer to the heading “Cash Flows from Financing Activities” below. We have a history of borrowing funds both domestically and\\ninternationally at reasonable interest rates, and we expect to be able to continue to borrow funds at reasonable rates over the long term. Our debt financing also includes the use\\nof a commercial paper program. We currently have the ability to borrow funds in this market at levels that are consistent with our debt financing strategy, and we expect to\\ncontinue to be able to do so in the future. The Company regularly reviews its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt.\\n1\\n2\\n1 \\n2 \\n51\\nThe Company’s cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities totaled $11.6\\xa0billion as of December\\xa031, 2022. In addition to these funds, our\\ncommercial paper program and our ability to issue long-term debt, we had $4.4 billion in unused backup lines of credit for general corporate purposes as of December\\xa031, 2022.\\nThese backup lines of credit expire at various times from 2023 through 2028.\\nOur current capital allocation priorities are as follows: investing wisely to support our business operations, continuing to grow our dividend payment, enhancing our beverage\\nportfolio and capabilities through consumer-centric acquisitions, and using excess cash to repurchase shares over time. We currently expect 2023 capital expenditures to be\\napproximately $1.9\\xa0billion. During 2023, we also expect to repurchase shares to offset dilution resulting from employee stock-based compensation plans.\\nWe are currently in litigation with the IRS for tax years 2007 through 2009. On November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued the Opinion in which it predominantly sided with the\\nIRS; however, a final decision is still pending and the timing of such decision is not currently known. The Company strongly disagrees with the IRS’ positions and the portions\\nof the Opinion affirming such positions and intends to vigorously defend our positions utilizing every available avenue of appeal. While the Company believes that it is more\\nlikely than not that we will ultimately prevail in this litigation upon appeal, it is possible that all, or some portion of, the adjustments proposed by the IRS and sustained by the\\nTax Court could ultimately be upheld. In the event that all of the adjustments proposed by the IRS were ultimately upheld for tax years 2007 through 2009 and the IRS, with the\\nconsent of the federal courts, were to decide to apply the Tax Court Methodology to the subsequent years up to and including 2022, the Company currently estimates that the\\npotential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability could be approximately $14\\xa0billion as of December\\xa031, 2022. Additional income tax and interest would continue to\\naccrue until the time any such potential liability, or portion thereof, were to be paid. Once the Tax Court renders a final decision, the Company will have 90 days to file a notice\\nof appeal and pay the portion of the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability related to the 2007 through 2009 tax years, which we currently estimate to be\\napproximately $5.2 billion (including interest accrued through December\\xa031, 2022), plus any additional interest accrued through the time of payment. Refer to Note\\xa011 of Notes\\nto Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the tax litigation.\\nWhile we believe it is more likely than not that we will prevail in the tax litigation discussed above, we are confident that, between our ability to generate cash flows from\\noperating activities and our ability to borrow funds at reasonable interest rates, we can manage the range of possible outcomes in the final resolution of the matter.\\nBased on all of the aforementioned factors, the Company believes its current liquidity position is strong and will continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and\\ncash commitments for investing and financing activities for the foreseeable future.\\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\\nAs part of our continued efforts to improve our working capital efficiency, we have worked with our suppliers over the past several years to revisit terms and conditions,\\nincluding the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with the majority of our suppliers are 120 days. Additionally, two global financial institutions offer a\\nvoluntary supply chain finance (“SCF”) program which enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from the Company to these financial institutions\\non a non-recourse basis at a rate that leverages our credit rating and thus may be more beneficial to them. The SCF program is available to suppliers of goods and services\\nincluded in cost of goods sold as well as suppliers of goods and services included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income. The\\nCompany and our suppliers agree on contractual terms for the goods and services we procure, including prices, quantities and payment terms, regardless of whether the supplier\\nelects to participate in the SCF program. The suppliers sell goods or services, as applicable, to the Company and issue the associated invoices to the Company based on the\\nagreed-upon contractual terms. Then, if they are participating in the SCF program, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, determine which invoices, if any, they want to sell to\\nthe financial institutions. Our suppliers’ voluntary inclusion of invoices in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms. No guarantees are provided by the Company\\nor any of our subsidiaries under the SCF program. We have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to participate in the SCF program, and we have no direct financial\\nrelationship with the financial institutions, as it relates to the SCF program. Accordingly, amounts due to our suppliers that elected to participate in the SCF program are\\nincluded in the line item accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet. All activity related to amounts due to suppliers that elected to participate in\\nthe SCF program is reflected within the operating activities section of our consolidated statement of cash flows. We have been informed by the financial institutions that as of\\nDecember\\xa031, 2022 and 2021, suppliers had elected to sell $1,234\\xa0million and $882\\xa0million, respectively, of our outstanding payment obligations to the financial institutions.\\nThe amounts settled through the SCF program were $4,724\\xa0million and $3,237\\xa0million during the years ended December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We do not believe\\nthere is a risk that our payment terms will be shortened in the near future.\\n52\\nThe Company has a trade accounts receivable factoring program in certain countries. Under this program, we can elect to sell trade accounts receivables to unaffiliated financial\\ninstitutions at a discount. In these factoring arrangements, for ease of administration, the Company collects customer payments related to the factored receivables and remits\\nthose payments to the financial institutions. The Company sold $10,709\\xa0million and $6,266\\xa0million of trade accounts receivables under this program during the years ended\\nDecember\\xa031, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The costs of factoring such receivables were $27 million and $5 million for the years ended December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021,\\nrespectively. The cash received from the financial institutions is classified within the operating activities section in our consolidated statement of cash flows.\\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021 was $11,018\\xa0million and $12,625\\xa0million, respectively, a decrease of $1,607\\xa0million,\\nor 13 percent. This decrease was primarily driven by higher marketing payments resulting from 2021 year-end accruals, an unfavorable impact due to foreign currency\\nexchange rate fluctuations, the buildup of inventory to manage potential supply chain disruptions, and higher annual incentive and tax payments in 2022. These items were\\npartially offset by increased operating income, lower payments related to our strategic realignment initiatives, and increased benefits from the extension of certain vendor\\npayment terms and our trade accounts receivable factoring program.\\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\\nNet cash used in investing activities was $763\\xa0million and $2,765\\xa0million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.\\nPurchases of Investments and Proceeds from Disposals of Investments\\nIn 2022, purchases of investments were $3,751 million and proceeds from disposals of investments were $4,771 million, resulting in a net cash inflow of $1,020 million. In\\n2021, purchases of investments were $6,030\\xa0million and proceeds from disposals of investments were $7,059\\xa0million, resulting in a net cash inflow of $1,029\\xa0million. This\\nactivity primarily represents the purchases of, and proceeds from the disposals of, investments in marketable securities and short-term investments that were made as part of the\\nCompany’s overall cash management strategy. Also included in this activity are purchases of, and proceeds from the disposals of, investments held by our captive insurance\\ncompanies.\\nAcquisitions of Businesses, Equity Method Investments and Nonmarketable Securities\\nIn 2022, the Company’s acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $73\\xa0million.\\nIn 2021, the Company’s acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $4,766\\xa0million, which primarily related to the acquisition of\\nthe remaining ownership interest in BodyArmor.\\nRefer to Note\\xa02 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our acquisitions.\\nProceeds from Disposals of Businesses, Equity Method Investments and Nonmarketable Securities\\nIn 2022, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $458 million, which primarily related to the refranchising of\\nour bottling operations in Cambodia and the sale of our ownership interest in one of our equity method investments.\\nIn 2021, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $2,180\\xa0million, which primarily related to the sale of our\\nownership interest in CCA, an equity method investee, to CCEP, also an equity method investee.\\nRefer to Note\\xa02 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our disposals.\\nPurchases of Property, Plant and Equipment\\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment during the years ended December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021 were $1,484 million and $1,367\\xa0million, respectively.\\n53\\nTotal capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and the percentage of such totals by operating segment and Corporate were as follows (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2022\\n2021\\nCapital expenditures\\n$\\n1,484\\xa0\\n$\\n1,367\\xa0\\nEurope, Middle East\\xa0& Africa\\n3.3\\xa0%\\n2.6\\xa0%\\nLatin America\\n0.3\\xa0\\n0.1\\xa0\\nNorth America\\n18.9\\xa0\\n16.7\\xa0\\nAsia Pacific\\n1.5\\xa0\\n4.8\\xa0\\nGlobal Ventures\\n12.0\\xa0\\n20.8\\xa0\\nBottling Investments\\n47.0\\xa0\\n41.0\\xa0\\nCorporate\\n17.0\\xa0\\n14.0\\xa0\\nCollateral (Paid) Received Associated with Hedging Activities — Net\\nCollateral paid associated with our hedging activities during the year ended December\\xa031, 2022 was $1,465 million. Refer to Note\\xa05 of Notes to Consolidated Financial\\nStatements for additional information on our hedging activities.\\nOther Investing Activities\\nDuring the years ended December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021, the total cash inflow for other investing activities was $706 million and $51 million, respectively. The activities during\\n2022 included cash proceeds of $823 million received in advance of the refranchising of our bottling operations in Vietnam. Refer to Note\\xa02 of Notes to Consolidated Financial\\nStatements for additional information on this transaction.\\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\\nNet cash used in financing activities was $10,250 million and $6,786\\xa0million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.\\nDebt Financing\\nOur Company maintains debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flows, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital. We use debt financing to lower our\\noverall cost of capital, which increases our return on shareowners’ equity. This exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates. Our interest expense may also be affected by our\\ncredit ratings.\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2022, our long-term debt was rated “A+” by Standard\\xa0& Poor’s and “A1” by Moody’s. Our commercial paper program was rated “A-1” by Standard\\xa0&\\nPoor’s and “P-1” by Moody’s. In assessing our credit strength, both rating agencies consider our capital structure (including the amount and maturity dates of our debt) and\\nfinancial policies as well as the consolidated balance sheet and other financial information of the Company. In addition, certain rating agencies also consider the financial\\ninformation of certain bottlers, including CCEP, Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc., Coca-Cola FEMSA and Coca-Cola Hellenic. While the Company has no legal obligation for the\\ndebt of these bottlers, the rating agencies believe the strategic importance of the bottlers to the Company’s business model provides the Company with an incentive to keep\\nthese bottlers viable. It is our expectation that these rating agencies will continue using this methodology. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded as a result of changes in\\nour capital structure, our major bottlers’ financial performance, changes in the credit rating agencies’ methodology in assessing our credit strength, or for any other reason, our\\ncost of borrowing could increase. Additionally, if certain bottlers’ credit ratings were to decline, the Company’s equity income could be reduced as a result of the potential\\nincrease in interest expense for those bottlers.\\nWe monitor our financial ratios and, as indicated above, the rating agencies consider these ratios in assessing our credit ratings. Each rating agency employs a different\\naggregation methodology and has different thresholds for the various financial ratios. These thresholds are not necessarily permanent, nor are they always fully disclosed to our\\nCompany.\\nOur global presence and strong capital position give us access to key financial markets around the world, enabling us to borrow funds at a low effective cost. This posture,\\ncoupled with active management of our mix of short-term and long-term debt as well as our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, results in a lower overall cost of\\nborrowing. Our debt management policies, in conjunction with our share repurchase program and investment activity, can result in current liabilities exceeding current assets.\\nIssuances and payments of debt included both short-term and long-term financing activities. During 2022, the Company had issuances of debt of $3,972 million, which\\nincluded $2,321 million of issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days, $798 million of net issuances of commercial paper and\\nshort-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less, and long-term debt issuances of $853 million, net of related discounts and issuance costs.\\n54\\nDuring 2022, the Company made payments of debt of $4,930 million, which consisted of $3,623 million of payments related to commercial paper and short-term debt with\\nmaturities greater than 90\\xa0days and payments of long-term debt of $1,307\\xa0million.\\nDuring 2021, the Company had issuances of debt of $13,094 million, which included $3,391 million of issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities\\ngreater than 90 days, $80 million of net issuances of commercial paper and short-term debt with maturities of 90 days or less, and long-term debt issuances of $9,623 million,\\nnet of related discounts and issuance costs.\\nDuring 2021, the Company made payments of debt of $12,866 million, which consisted of $2,357 million of payments related to commercial paper and short-term debt with\\nmaturities greater than 90\\xa0days and payments of long-term debt of $10,509\\xa0million.\\nOn December 31, 2021, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, the governing body responsible for regulating LIBOR, ceased to publish certain LIBOR reference\\nrates. However, other LIBOR reference rates, including U.S. dollar overnight, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month maturities, will continue to be published through June\\n2023. In preparation for the discontinuation of LIBOR, we have amended, or will amend, our LIBOR-referencing agreements to either reference the Secured Overnight\\nFinancing Rate or include mechanics for selecting an alternative rate. We do not plan to enter into variable-rate agreements that reference LIBOR in the future.\\nIssuances of Stock\\nThe issuances of stock in 2022 and 2021 were related to the exercise of stock options by employees.\\nShare Repurchases\\nIn 2012, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase plan of up to 500\\xa0million shares (“2012 Plan”) of the Company’s common stock. In May 2022, the Company\\nreached the maximum number of shares that could be repurchased under the 2012 Plan and thereby completed the plan. In 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a new share\\nrepurchase plan of up to 150\\xa0million shares of the Company’s common stock.\\nDuring 2022, the total cash outflow for treasury stock purchases was $1,418 million. The Company repurchased 21.3\\xa0million shares of common stock under the share\\nrepurchase plans authorized by our Board of Directors. These shares were repurchased at an average price per share of $62.67, for a total cost of $1,336 million. Since the\\ninception of our share repurchase program in 1984, we have repurchased 3.5\\xa0billion shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $17.53. In addition to shares\\nrepurchased under the share repurchase plans authorized by our Board of Directors, the Company’s treasury stock activity also includes shares surrendered to the Company to\\npay the exercise price and/or to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with so-called stock swap exercises of employee stock options and/or the vesting of restricted\\nstock issued to employees. The net impact of the Company’s issuances of stock and share repurchases during 2022 resulted in a net cash outflow of $581 million.\\nDuring 2021, the Company did not repurchase shares of our common stock under the share repurchase plans authorized by our Board of Directors.\\nDividends\\nThe Company paid dividends of $7,616 million and $7,252 million during the years ended December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\\nAt its February 2023 meeting, our Board of Directors increased our regular quarterly dividend to $0.46 per share, equivalent to a full year dividend of $1.84 per share in 2023.\\nThis is our 61  consecutive annual increase. Our annualized common stock dividend was $1.76 per share and $1.68 per share in 2022 and 2021, respectively.\\nOther Financing Activities\\nDuring the years ended December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021, the total cash outflow for other financing activities was $1,095 million and $353 million, respectively. The activities\\nduring 2022 included payments totaling $637 million related to the BodyArmor acquisition, which included amounts originally held back for indemnification obligations.\\nAdditionally, other financing activities during 2022 and 2021 included repayments of collateral related to our hedging programs.\\nst\\n55\\nContractual Obligations\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2022, the Company’s contractual obligations, including payments due by period, were as follows (in millions):\\nPayments Due by Period\\nTotal\\n2023\\n2024-2025\\n2026-2027\\n2028 and\\nThereafter\\nLoans and notes payable:\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0 \\xa0\\nCommercial paper borrowings\\n$\\n2,146\\xa0 $\\n2,146\\xa0 $\\n—\\xa0 $\\n—\\xa0 $\\n—\\xa0\\nLines of credit and other short-term borrowings\\n227\\xa0\\n227\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\nCurrent maturities of long-term debt\\n397\\xa0\\n397\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\nLong-term debt, net of current maturities\\n38,038\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n3,108\\xa0\\n6,290\\xa0\\n28,640\\xa0\\nEstimated interest payments\\n10,236\\xa0\\n780\\xa0\\n1,181\\xa0\\n988\\xa0\\n7,287\\xa0\\nAccrued income taxes\\n3,366\\xa0\\n1,203\\xa0\\n2,163\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\nPurchase obligations\\n20,856\\xa0\\n13,099\\xa0\\n2,066\\xa0\\n1,333\\xa0\\n4,358\\xa0\\nMarketing obligations\\n4,615\\xa0\\n2,800\\xa0\\n837\\xa0\\n505\\xa0\\n473\\xa0\\nLease obligations\\n2,291\\xa0\\n466\\xa0\\n680\\xa0\\n411\\xa0\\n734\\xa0\\nAcquisition obligations\\n1,937\\xa0\\n610\\xa0\\n1,327\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\nHeld-for-sale and related obligations\\n1,187\\xa0\\n1,164\\xa0\\n17\\xa0\\n5\\xa0\\n1\\xa0\\nTotal contractual obligations\\n$\\n85,296\\xa0 $\\n22,892\\xa0 $\\n11,379\\xa0 $\\n9,532\\xa0 $\\n41,493\\xa0\\nRefer to Note\\xa010 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding loans and notes payable. Upon payment of outstanding commercial paper, we typically issue\\nnew commercial paper. Lines of credit and other short-term borrowings are expected to fluctuate depending upon current liquidity needs, especially at international subsidiaries.\\nRefer to Note\\xa010 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding long-term debt. We will consider several alternatives for settling this long-term debt,\\nincluding the use of cash flows from operating activities, issuance of commercial paper or issuance of other long-term debt. The table above shows expected cash payments to be made by the\\nCompany and excludes the noncash portion of debt, including any fair market value adjustments, unamortized discounts and premiums.\\nWe calculated estimated interest payments for our long-term debt based on the applicable rates and payment dates. For our variable-rate debt, we have assumed the December\\xa031, 2022 rate for all\\nperiods presented. We expect to fund such interest payments with cash flows from operating activities and/or short-term borrowings.\\nRefer to Note\\xa014 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding income taxes. Accrued income taxes include $2,886 million related to the one-time transition\\ntax required by the Tax Reform Act. Liabilities of $1,424 million for unrecognized tax benefits plus accrued interest and penalties are not included in the total above. Currently, the settlement\\nperiod for the unrecognized tax benefits cannot be determined. In addition, any payments related to unrecognized tax benefits may be partially or fully offset by reductions in payments in other\\njurisdictions.\\nPurchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. These agreements include long-term\\ncontractual obligations, open purchase orders, accounts payable and certain accrued liabilities. We expect to fund these purchase obligations with cash flows from operating activities.\\nWe expect to fund these marketing obligations with cash flows from operating activities.\\nRepresents obligations related to our acquisitions of fairlife and BodyArmor. Refer to Note\\xa02 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\\nRepresents $823 million received in December 2022 in advance of the refranchising of the Company’s bottling operations in Vietnam in January 2023 as well as liabilities and contractual\\nobligations that were classified as held for sale. Refer to Note\\xa02 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\\nThe total accrued liability for pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized as of December\\xa031, 2022 was $942\\xa0million. Refer to Note\\xa013 of Notes to Consolidated\\nFinancial Statements. This amount is impacted by, among other items, net periodic benefit cost or income, plan funding levels, plan amendments, changes in plan demographics\\nand assumptions, and the investment return on plan assets. Because the accrued liability does not represent expected liquidity needs, we did not include this amount in the table\\nabove.\\nWe expect to make all contributions to our pension trusts with cash flows from operating activities. Our pension plans are generally funded in accordance with local laws and\\ntax regulations. The Company expects to contribute approximately $42\\xa0million in 2023 to our pension trusts, all of which will be allocated to our international plans. Refer to\\nNote\\xa013 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We did not include our estimated contributions to our pension trusts in the table above.\\n1\\n2\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n56\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2022, the projected benefit obligation of the U.S. qualified pension plan was $4,101 million, and the fair value of the plan assets was $4,336 million. The\\nprojected benefit obligation of all pension plans other than the U.S. qualified pension plan was $2,275 million, and the fair value of the plans’ assets was $2,822 million. The\\nCompany sponsors various unfunded pension plans outside the United States as well as unfunded nonqualified pension plans covering certain U.S. employees. These U.S.\\nnonqualified pension plans provide benefits that are not permitted to be funded through a qualified plan because of limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The\\nexpected benefit payments for these unfunded pension plans are not included in the table above. However, we anticipate benefit payments for these unfunded pension plans will\\nbe approximately $65\\xa0million annually for 2023 through 2025. Thereafter, the expected annual benefit payments will gradually decline. Refer to Note\\xa013 of Notes to\\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\\nIn general, we are self-insured for large portions of many different types of claims; however, we do use commercial insurance above our self-insured retentions to reduce the\\nCompany’s risk of catastrophic loss. Our reserves for the Company’s self-insured losses are estimated using actuarial methods and assumptions of the insurance industry,\\nadjusted for our specific expectations based on our claims history. As of December\\xa031, 2022, our self-insurance reserves totaled $199 million. Refer to Note\\xa011 of Notes to\\nConsolidated Financial Statements. We did not include estimated payments related to our self-insurance reserves in the table above.\\nDeferred income tax liabilities as of December\\xa031, 2022 were $2,914 million. Refer to Note\\xa014 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This amount is not included in\\nthe table above because we believe that presentation would not be meaningful. Deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax\\nbases of assets and liabilities and their respective book bases, which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the underlying assets or liabilities are settled at their\\nreported financial statement amounts. The results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future years. As a result,\\nscheduling deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading, because this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs.\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2022, we were contingently liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third parties of $1,017 million, of which $133 million was related to VIEs. Our\\nguarantees are primarily related to third-party customers, bottlers and vendors and arose through the normal course of business. These guarantees have various terms, and none\\nof these guarantees is individually significant. These amounts represent the maximum potential future payments that we could be required to make under the guarantees.\\nHowever, management has concluded that the likelihood of any significant amounts being paid by our Company under these guarantees is not probable. As of December\\xa031,\\n2022, we were not directly liable for the debt of any unconsolidated entity.\\nForeign Exchange\\nOur international operations are subject to certain opportunities and risks, including currency fluctuations and governmental actions. We closely monitor our operations in each\\ncountry and seek to adopt appropriate strategies that are responsive to changing economic and political environments as well as to fluctuations in currencies. Due to the\\ngeographic diversity of our operations, weakness in some currencies may be offset by strength in other currencies over time.\\nIn 2022 and 2021, the weighted-average exchange rates for foreign currencies in which the Company conducted operations (all operating currencies), and for certain individual\\ncurrencies, strengthened (weakened) against the U.S. dollar as follows:\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2022\\n2021\\nAll operating currencies\\n(8)%\\n2\\xa0%\\nAustralian dollar\\n(7)%\\n10\\xa0%\\nBrazilian real\\n4\\xa0\\n(4)\\nBritish pound sterling\\n(11)\\n3\\xa0\\nEuro\\n(11)\\n5\\xa0\\nJapanese yen\\n(17)\\n(2)\\nMexican peso\\n1\\xa0\\n6\\xa0\\nSouth African rand\\n(9)\\n6\\xa0\\nThe percentages in the table above do not include the effects of our hedging activities and, therefore, do not reflect the actual impact of fluctuations in foreign currency\\nexchange rates on our operating results. Our hedging activities are designed to mitigate, over time, a portion of the potentially unfavorable impact of exchange rate fluctuations\\non our net income.\\nThe total impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on net operating revenues, including the effect of our hedging activities, was a decrease of 7 percent in 2022 and\\nan increase of 1 percent in 2021. The total impact of foreign currency\\n57\\nexchange rate fluctuations on income before income taxes, including the effect of our hedging activities, was a decrease of 6 percent in 2022 and an increase of 2 percent in\\n2021.\\nForeign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily the result of the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities from certain currencies into functional currencies.\\nThe effects of the remeasurement of these assets and liabilities are partially offset by the impact of our economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated\\nbalance sheet. Refer to Note\\xa05 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses are recorded in the line item other income (loss)\\xa0—\\nnet in our consolidated statement of income. Refer to the heading “Operations Review\\xa0— Other Income (Loss)\\xa0— Net” above. The Company recorded net foreign currency\\nexchange losses of $236\\xa0million and $61\\xa0million during the years ended December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\\nInflation affects the way we operate in many markets around the world. In general, we believe that, over time, we will be able to increase prices to counteract the majority of the\\ninflationary effects of increasing costs and to generate sufficient cash flows to maintain our productive capability.\\nITEM 7A.\\xa0\\xa0QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\\nOur Company uses derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices\\nand other market risks. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. As a matter of policy, all of our derivative positions are used to reduce risk by\\nhedging an underlying economic exposure. Because of the high correlation between the hedging instruments and the underlying exposures, fluctuations in the values of the\\ninstruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the values of the underlying exposures.\\nWe monitor our exposure to market risks using several objective measurement systems, including a sensitivity analysis to measure our exposure to fluctuations in foreign\\ncurrency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Refer to Note\\xa05 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our hedging\\ntransactions and derivative financial instruments.\\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates\\nWe manage most of our foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows us to net certain exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets. In 2022, we\\ngenerated $27.6\\xa0billion of our net operating revenues from operations outside the United States. Due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weakness in some currencies\\nmay be offset by strength in other currencies over time. We use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate\\nfluctuations.\\nOur Company enters into forward exchange contracts and purchases foreign currency options and collars (principally euro, British pound sterling and Japanese yen) to hedge\\ncertain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. Additionally, we enter into forward exchange contracts to offset the earnings impact related to\\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain monetary assets and liabilities. We also enter into forward exchange contracts as hedges of net investments in foreign\\noperations.\\nThe total notional values of our foreign currency derivatives were $11,370 million and $13,691 million as of December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These values included\\nderivative instruments that were designated and qualified for hedge accounting along with derivative instruments that are economic hedges. The fair value of foreign currency\\nderivatives that qualified for hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized loss of $66 million as of December\\xa031, 2022, and we estimate that a 10 percent weakening of the\\nU.S. dollar would have increased the net unrealized loss to $296 million. The fair value of the foreign currency derivatives that did not qualify for hedge accounting resulted in\\na net unrealized loss of $20 million as of December\\xa031, 2022, and we estimate that a 10 percent weakening of the U.S. dollar would have resulted in a $137 million decrease in\\nfair value.\\nInterest Rates\\nThe Company is subject to interest rate volatility with regard to existing and future issuances of debt. We monitor our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt as well as our mix\\nof short-term debt and long-term debt. From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations.\\nBased on the Company’s variable-rate debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of December\\xa031, 2022, we estimate that a 1\\xa0percentage point increase in interest rates\\nwould have increased interest expense by $136 million in 2022. However, this increase in interest expense would have been partially offset by the increase in interest income\\ndue to higher interest rates.\\n58\\nThe Company is subject to interest rate risk related to its investments in highly liquid debt securities. These investments are primarily managed by external managers within the\\nguidelines of the Company’s investment policy. Our policy requires these investments to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the risk of principal\\nloss. In addition, our policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. We estimate that a 1 percentage point increase in interest rates would have resulted in a $29\\nmillion decrease in the fair value of our portfolio of highly liquid debt securities.\\nCommodity Prices\\nThe Company is subject to market risk with respect to commodity price fluctuations, principally related to our purchases of sweeteners, metals, juices, PET and fuels. We\\nmanage our exposure to commodity risks primarily through the use of supplier pricing agreements, which enable us to establish the purchase prices for certain inputs that are\\nused in our manufacturing and distribution operations. When deemed appropriate, we use derivative financial instruments to further manage our exposure to commodity risks.\\nCertain of these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, but they are effective economic hedges that help the Company mitigate the price risk associated with the\\npurchases and transportation of materials used in our manufacturing processes.\\nThe total notional values of our commodity derivatives were $371 million and $918 million as of December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These values included derivative\\ninstruments that were designated and qualified for hedge accounting along with derivative instruments that are economic hedges. There were no significant commodity\\nderivatives that qualified for hedge accounting as of December\\xa031, 2022. The fair value of the commodity derivatives that did not qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a net\\nloss of $1 million as of December\\xa031, 2022, and we estimate that a 10 percent decrease in underlying commodity prices would have resulted in an $8\\xa0million decrease in fair\\nvalue.\\n59\\nITEM 8.\\xa0\\xa0FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\\nTable of

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\\nWhen used in these notes, the terms “The Coca-Cola Company,” “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” mean The Coca-Cola Company and all entities included in our consolidated\\nfinancial statements.\\nDescription of Business\\nThe Coca-Cola Company is a total beverage company. We own or license and market numerous beverage brands, which we group into the following categories: Trademark\\nCoca-Cola; sparkling flavors; water, sports, coffee and tea; juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages; and emerging beverages. We own and market five of the world’s\\ntop six nonalcoholic sparkling soft drink brands: Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and Diet Coke/Coca-Cola Light. Finished beverage products bearing our\\ntrademarks, sold in the United States since 1886, are now sold in more than 200 countries and territories.\\nWe make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of independent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and\\nretailers as well as the Company’s consolidated bottling and distribution operations. Beverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to us account for 2.2\\xa0billion of the\\nestimated 64 billion servings of all beverages consumed worldwide every day.\\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nBasis of Presentation\\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). The\\npreparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses\\nand the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Although these estimates are based on our knowledge of\\ncurrent events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and assumptions. Furthermore, when testing assets for\\nimpairment in future periods, if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur, impairment charges may result.\\nPrinciples of Consolidation\\nOur Company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest. Additionally, there are situations in which consolidation is required even\\nthough the usual condition of consolidation (i.e., ownership of a majority voting interest) does not apply. Generally, this occurs when an entity holds an interest in another\\nbusiness enterprise that was achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests, which results in a disproportionate relationship between such entity’s voting\\ninterests in, and its exposure to the economic risks and potential rewards of, the other business enterprise. This disproportionate relationship results in what is known as a\\nvariable interest, and the entity in which we have the variable interest is referred to as a “VIE.” An enterprise must consolidate a VIE if it is determined to be the primary\\nbeneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary has both (1)\\xa0the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and\\n(2)\\xa0the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\\nOur Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling operations, for which we were not determined to be the primary beneficiary. Our variable interests in these\\nVIEs primarily relate to equity investments, profit guarantees or subordinated financial support. Refer to Note\\xa011. Although these financial arrangements resulted in our holding\\nvariable interests in these entities, they did not empower us to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs’ economic performance. Our Company’s\\ninvestments, plus any loans and guarantees, and other subordinated financial support related to these VIEs totaled $1,626 million and $1,980 million as of December\\xa031, 2022\\nand 2021, respectively, representing our maximum exposures to loss. The Company’s investments, plus any loans and guarantees, related to these VIEs were not individually\\nsignificant to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\\nIn addition, our Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling operations, for which we were determined to be the primary beneficiary. As a result, we have\\nconsolidated these entities. Our Company’s investments, plus any loans and guarantees, related to these VIEs totaled $109 million and $103 million as of December\\xa031, 2022\\nand 2021, respectively, representing our maximum exposures to loss. The assets and liabilities of VIEs for which we are the primary beneficiary were not significant to the\\nCompany’s consolidated financial statements.\\nCreditors of our VIEs do not have recourse against the general credit of the Company, regardless of whether they are accounted for as consolidated entities.\\n66\\nWe use the equity method to account for investments in companies if our investment provides us with the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial\\npolicies of the investee. Our consolidated net income includes our Company’s proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies. Our judgment regarding the\\nlevel of influence over each equity method investee includes considering key factors, such as our ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in\\npolicy-making decisions, other commercial arrangements and material intercompany transactions.\\nWe eliminate from our financial results all significant intercompany transactions, including the intercompany transactions with consolidated VIEs and the intercompany portion\\nof transactions with equity method investees.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nOur Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations under the terms of the contracts with our customers are satisfied. Our performance obligation generally\\nconsists of the promise to sell concentrates, syrups or finished products to our bottling partners, wholesalers, distributors or retailers.\\xa0Refer to\\xa0Note\\xa03.\\xa0\\nAdvertising Costs\\nOur Company expenses production costs of print, radio, television and other advertisements as of the first date the advertisements take place. All other marketing expenditures\\nare expensed in the annual period in which the expenditure is incurred. Advertising costs included in the line item selling, general and administrative expenses in our\\nconsolidated statements of income were $4 billion, $4 billion and $3 billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021, advertising and\\nproduction costs of $35 million and $57 million, respectively, were primarily recorded in the line item prepaid expenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance\\nsheets.\\nShipping and Handling Costs\\nShipping and handling costs related to the movement of goods from our manufacturing locations to our sales distribution centers are included in the line item cost of goods sold\\nin our consolidated statement of income. Shipping and handling costs incurred to move goods from our manufacturing locations or sales distribution centers to our customers\\nare also included in the line item cost of goods sold in our consolidated statement of income, except for costs incurred to distribute goods sold by our consolidated bottlers to\\nour customers, which are included in the line item selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income. Our customers generally do not pay us\\nseparately for shipping and handling costs. We recognize the cost of shipping and handling activities that are performed after a customer obtains control of the goods as costs to\\nfulfill our promise to provide goods to the customer. As a result of this election, the Company does not evaluate whether shipping and handling activities are services promised\\nto customers. If revenue is recognized for the related goods before the shipping and handling activities occur, the related costs of those shipping and handling activities are\\naccrued.\\nSales, Use, Value-Added and Excise Taxes\\nThe Company collects taxes imposed directly on its customers related to sales, use, value-added, excise and other similar taxes. The Company then remits such taxes on behalf\\nof its customers to the applicable governmental authorities. We exclude from net operating revenues the tax amounts imposed on revenue-producing transactions that were\\ncollected from our customers to be remitted to governmental authorities. Accordingly, such tax amounts are recorded in the line item trade accounts receivable in our\\nconsolidated balance sheet when collection of taxes from the customer has not yet occurred and are recorded in the line item accounts payable and accrued expenses in our\\nconsolidated balance sheet until they are remitted to the applicable governmental authorities. Taxes imposed directly on the Company, whether based on receipts from sales,\\ninventory procurement costs or manufacturing activities, are recorded in the line item cost of goods sold in our consolidated statement of income.\\nNet Income Per Share\\nBasic net income per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to shareowners of The Coca-Cola Company by the weighted-average number of common shares\\noutstanding during the reporting period. Diluted net income per share is computed similarly to basic net income per share, except that it includes the potential dilution that\\ncould occur if dilutive securities were exercised. We excluded 8 million, 6 million and 6 million stock options from the computation of diluted net income per share in 2022,\\n2021 and 2020, respectively, because the stock options would have been antidilutive.\\nCash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents\\nWe classify time deposits and other investments that are highly liquid and have maturities of\\xa0three\\xa0months or less at the date of purchase as cash equivalents or restricted cash\\nequivalents, as applicable. Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents generally consist of amounts held by our captive insurance companies, which are included in the line\\nitem other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheet. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, diversification\\nof counterparties and procedures to monitor our concentrations of credit risk.\\n67\\nThe following table provides a summary of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents that constitute the total amounts shown in our consolidated\\nstatements of cash flows (in millions):\\nDecember 31,\\n2022\\n2021\\n2020\\nCash and cash equivalents\\n$\\n9,519\\xa0 $\\n9,684\\xa0 $\\n6,795\\xa0\\nRestricted cash and restricted cash equivalents\\n306\\xa0\\n341\\xa0\\n315\\xa0\\nCash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents\\n$\\n9,825\\xa0 $\\n10,025\\xa0 $\\n7,110\\xa0\\nAmounts include cash and cash equivalents in our solvency capital portfolio, which are included in the line item other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note\\xa04.\\nAmounts as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 include cash and cash equivalents related to assets held for sale, which are included in the line item prepaid expenses and other current assets in our\\nconsolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note\\xa02.\\nShort-Term Investments\\nWe classify time deposits and other investments that have maturities of greater than three months but less than one year as short-term investments.\\nInvestments in Equity and Debt Securities\\nWe measure all equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value with the change in fair value included in\\nnet income. We use quoted market prices to determine the fair value of equity securities with readily determinable fair values. For equity securities without readily determinable\\nfair values, we have elected the measurement alternative under which we measure these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from\\nobservable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Management assesses each of these investments on an individual\\nbasis. Our investments in debt securities are carried at either amortized cost or fair value. Investments in debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to\\nhold to maturity are carried at amortized cost and classified as held-to-maturity. Investments in debt securities that are not classified as held-to-maturity are carried at fair value\\nand classified as either trading or available-for-sale. Refer to Note\\xa04 for additional information on our policy for investments, which includes our assessment of impairments.\\nTrade Accounts Receivable\\nWe record trade accounts receivable at net realizable value. This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts to reflect any expected loss on the\\ntrade accounts receivable balances and charged to the provision for doubtful accounts. We calculate this allowance based on available relevant information, in addition to\\nhistorical loss information, the level of past-due accounts based on the contractual terms of the receivables, and our relationships with, and the economic status of, our bottling\\npartners and customers. We believe our exposure to concentrations of credit risk is limited due to the diverse geographic areas covered by our operations.\\nThe Company has a trade accounts receivable factoring program in certain countries. Under this program, we can elect to sell trade accounts receivables to unaffiliated financial\\ninstitutions at a discount. In these factoring arrangements, for ease of administration, the Company collects customer payments related to the factored receivables and remits\\nthose payments to the financial institutions. The Company sold $10,709\\xa0million and $6,266\\xa0million of trade accounts receivables under this program during the years ended\\nDecember\\xa031, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The costs of factoring such receivables were $27 million and $5 million for the years ended December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021,\\nrespectively. The Company accounts for this program as a sale, and accordingly, the trade receivables sold are excluded from the line item trade accounts receivable in our\\nconsolidated balance sheet. The cash received from the financial institutions is classified within the operating activities section in our consolidated statement of cash flows.\\nInventories\\nInventories consist primarily of raw materials and packaging (which include ingredients and supplies) and finished goods (which include concentrates and syrups in our\\nconcentrate operations and finished beverages in our finished product operations). Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We determine cost on the\\nbasis of the average cost or first-in, first-out methods.\\n1,2\\n1\\n2\\n68\\nInventories consisted of the following (in millions):\\nDecember 31,\\n2022\\n2021\\nRaw materials and packaging\\n$\\n2,627\\xa0 $\\n2,133\\xa0\\nFinished goods\\n1,247\\xa0\\n982\\xa0\\nOther\\n359\\xa0\\n299\\xa0\\nTotal inventories\\n$\\n4,233\\xa0 $\\n3,414\\xa0\\nDerivative Instruments\\nWhen deemed appropriate, our Company uses derivatives as a risk management tool to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks. The primary market risks managed\\nby the Company through the use of derivative instruments are foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk and interest rate risk. All derivatives are carried at fair\\nvalue in our consolidated balance sheet in the following line items, as applicable: prepaid expenses and other current assets; other noncurrent assets; accounts payable and\\naccrued expenses; and other noncurrent liabilities. The cash flow impact of the Company’s derivative instruments is primarily included in our consolidated statement of cash\\nflows in net cash provided by operating activities. Refer to Note\\xa05.\\nLeases\\nWe determine if a contract contains a lease at its inception based on whether or not the Company has the right to control the asset during the contract period and other facts and\\ncircumstances. We are the lessee in a lease contract when we obtain the right to control the asset. Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets represent our right to use an\\nunderlying asset for the lease term and are included in the line item other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease liabilities represent our obligation\\nto make lease payments arising from the lease and are included in the line items accounts payable and accrued expenses and other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated\\nbalance sheet. Operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at\\nthe commencement date. When determining the lease term, we include renewal or termination options that we are reasonably certain to exercise. Leases with a lease term of 12\\nmonths or less at inception are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term in our\\nconsolidated statement of income. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, we use our local incremental borrowing rate based on the information available\\nat the commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. When our contracts contain lease and non-lease components, we account for both components\\nas a single lease component. Refer to Note\\xa09.\\nWe have various contracts for certain fountain equipment under which we are the lessor. These leases meet the criteria for operating lease classification. Lease income\\nassociated with these leases is not material.\\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Repair and maintenance costs that do not improve service potential or extend economic life are expensed as incurred.\\nDepreciation is recorded principally by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of our assets, which are reviewed periodically and generally have the following\\nranges: buildings and improvements: 40\\xa0years or less; and machinery and equipment: 20\\xa0years or less. Land is not depreciated, and construction in progress is not depreciated\\nuntil ready for service. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of the remaining lease term, including renewal options that we are\\nreasonably certain to exercise, or the estimated useful life of the improvement. Depreciation is not recorded during the period in which a long-lived asset or disposal group is\\nclassified as held for sale, even if the asset or disposal group continues to generate revenue during the period. Depreciation expense, including the depreciation expense of\\nassets under finance leases, totaled $1,125\\xa0million, $1,262\\xa0million and $1,301\\xa0million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Amortization expense for leasehold improvements\\ntotaled $13\\xa0million, $15\\xa0million and $18\\xa0million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\\n69\\nThe following table summarizes our property, plant and equipment (in millions):\\nDecember 31,\\n2022\\n2021\\nLand\\n$\\n611\\xa0 $\\n652\\xa0\\nBuildings and improvements\\n4,434\\xa0\\n4,349\\xa0\\nMachinery and equipment\\n14,030\\xa0\\n13,861\\xa0\\nProperty, plant and equipment — cost\\n19,075\\xa0\\n18,862\\xa0\\nLess: Accumulated depreciation\\n9,234\\xa0\\n8,942\\xa0\\nProperty, plant and equipment\\xa0— net\\n$\\n9,841\\xa0 $\\n9,920\\xa0\\nCertain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment should be assessed, including, among\\nothers, a significant decrease in market value, a significant change in the business climate in a particular market, or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with\\nhistorical losses or projected future losses. When such events or changes in circumstances are present and a recoverability test is performed, we estimate the future cash flows\\nexpected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal\\nplanning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment charge. The\\nimpairment charge recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to determine\\nthe fair value of property, plant and equipment, including appraisals and discounted cash flow models. These appraisals and models include assumptions we believe are\\nconsistent with those a market participant would use.\\nGoodwill, Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets\\nWe classify intangible assets into three categories: (1)\\xa0intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization; (2)\\xa0intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to\\namortization; and (3)\\xa0goodwill. We determine the useful lives of our identifiable intangible assets after considering the specific facts and circumstances related to each\\nintangible asset. Factors we consider when determining useful lives include the contractual term of any agreement related to the asset, the historical performance of the asset,\\nthe Company’s long-term strategy for using the asset, any laws or other local regulations which could impact the useful life of the asset, and other economic factors, including\\ncompetition and specific market conditions. Intangible assets that are deemed to have definite lives are amortized, primarily on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives,\\nwhich is less than 20 years. Refer to Note\\xa07.\\nWhen events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of definite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable, management performs a recoverability test of the\\ncarrying value by preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting profit and cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual\\ndisposition. These estimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without\\ninterest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment charge. The impairment charge recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the\\nasset or asset group exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of these assets, including discounted cash flow models, which include\\nassumptions we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use.\\nWe test intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives, including trademarks, franchise rights and goodwill, for impairment annually, or more frequently if events\\nor circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired. Our Company performs these annual impairment tests as of the first day of our third fiscal quarter. We use a variety of\\nmethodologies in conducting impairment tests of indefinite-lived intangible assets, including, but not limited to, discounted cash flow models, which include assumptions we\\nbelieve are consistent with those a market participant would use. For indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an\\nimpairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, other\\nthan goodwill, rather than completing the impairment test. The Company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its\\ncarrying amount. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing described above. Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any\\nfurther assessment.\\nWe perform impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level, which is generally one level below our operating segments. Our operating segments are primarily based on\\ngeographic responsibility, which is consistent with the way management runs our business. Our geographic operating segments are generally subdivided into smaller\\ngeographic regions. These geographic regions are our reporting units. Our Global Ventures operating segment includes the results of our Costa Limited (“Costa”), innocent and\\ndoğadan businesses, as well as fees earned pursuant to distribution coordination agreements between the Company and Monster Beverage Corporation (“Monster”), each of\\nwhich is its own reporting unit. The Bottling\\n70\\nInvestments operating segment includes all of our consolidated bottling operations, regardless of geographic location. Generally, each consolidated bottling operation within\\nour Bottling Investments operating segment is its own reporting unit. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or units that benefit from the synergies arising from each\\nbusiness combination.\\nIn order to test for goodwill impairment, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value,\\nincluding goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is written down for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the\\nfair value. However, the impairment charge recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. We typically use discounted cash flow models to determine the fair\\nvalue of a reporting unit. The assumptions used in these models are consistent with those we believe a market participant would use. The Company has the option to perform a\\nqualitative assessment of goodwill in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the\\nCompany concludes that this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing discussed above. Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any further assessment.\\nImpairment charges related to intangible assets, including goodwill, are generally recorded in the line item other operating charges or, to the extent they relate to equity method\\ninvestees, in the line item equity income (loss)\\xa0— net in our consolidated statement of income.\\nContingencies\\nOur Company is involved in various legal proceedings and tax matters. Due to their nature, such legal proceedings and tax matters involve inherent uncertainties, including, but\\nnot limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties and governmental actions. Management assesses the probability of loss for such contingencies and accrues a\\nliability and/or discloses the relevant circumstances, as appropriate. Refer to Note\\xa011.\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nOur Company grants long-term equity awards under its stock-based compensation plans to certain employees of the Company. These awards include stock options,\\nperformance share units, restricted stock and restricted stock units. The fair value of stock option awards is estimated using a Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The\\nCompany recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is generally four years.\\nThe fair value of restricted stock, restricted stock units and certain performance share units is the closing market price per share of the Company’s stock on the grant date less\\nthe present value of the expected dividends not received during the vesting period. The Company included a relative total shareowner return (“TSR”) modifier for most\\nperformance share unit awards granted from 2014 through 2017 as well as for performance share unit awards granted to executives from 2018 through 2022. For these awards,\\nthe number of performance share units earned based on the certified achievement of the predefined performance criteria will be reduced or increased if the Company’s total\\nshareowner return over the performance period relative to a predefined compensation comparator group of companies falls outside of a predefined range. The fair value of\\nperformance share units that include a TSR modifier is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model.\\nIn the reporting period it becomes probable that the minimum performance threshold specified in the performance share unit award will be achieved, we recognize\\ncompensation expense for the proportionate share of the total fair value of the performance share units related to the vesting period that has already lapsed for the performance\\nshare units expected to vest. The remaining fair value of the performance share units expected to vest is expensed on a straight-line basis over the remainder of the vesting\\nperiod. In the event the Company determines it is no longer probable that the minimum performance threshold specified in the award will be achieved, we reverse all of the\\npreviously recognized compensation expense in the reporting period such a determination is made.\\nThe Company has made a policy election to estimate the number of stock-based compensation awards that will ultimately vest to determine the amount of compensation\\nexpense recognized each reporting period.\\xa0Forfeiture estimates are trued-up at the end of the vesting period in order to ensure that compensation expense is recognized only for\\nthose awards that ultimately vest. Refer to Note\\xa012.\\nIncome Taxes\\nIncome tax expense includes U.S., state, local and international income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary\\ndifferences between the book basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The tax rate used to determine the deferred tax assets and liabilities is the enacted tax rate for the\\nyear and manner in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be\\nrealized.\\nThe Company is involved in various tax matters, with respect to some of which the outcome is uncertain. We establish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any\\nof our tax positions at the time we determine that it becomes uncertain based\\n71\\nupon one of the following conditions: (1)\\xa0the tax position is not “more likely than not” to be sustained; (2)\\xa0the tax position is “more likely than not” to be sustained, but for a\\nlesser amount; or (3)\\xa0the tax position is “more likely than not” to be sustained, but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken. For purposes of\\nevaluating whether or not a tax position is uncertain, (1)\\xa0we presume the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant\\ninformation; (2)\\xa0the technical merits of a tax position are derived from authorities such as legislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings and caselaw and their\\napplicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position; and (3)\\xa0each tax position is evaluated without consideration of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other\\ntax positions taken. A number of years may elapse before a particular uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved or when a tax assessment is raised. The number of\\nyears subject to tax assessments varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the “more likely than\\nnot” recognition threshold would be recognized in income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears under any one of the following conditions:\\n(1)\\xa0the tax position is “more likely than not” to be sustained; (2)\\xa0the tax position, amount and/or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation; or (3)\\xa0the statute of\\nlimitations for the tax position has expired. Refer to Note\\xa011 and Note\\xa014.\\nTranslation and Remeasurement\\nWe translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries from their respective functional currencies to U.S. dollars at the appropriate spot rates as of the balance sheet\\ndate. Generally, our foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency. Changes in the carrying values of these assets and liabilities attributable to\\nfluctuations in spot rates are recognized in net foreign currency translation adjustments, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”). Refer to\\nNote\\xa015. Accounts in our consolidated statement of income are translated using the monthly average exchange rates during the year.\\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency that is different from a reporting entity’s functional currency must be remeasured from the applicable currency to the\\nreporting entity’s functional currency. The effects of the remeasurement of these assets and liabilities are recognized in the line item other income (loss)\\xa0— net in our\\nconsolidated statement of income and are partially offset by the impact of our economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated balance sheet. Refer to\\nNote\\xa05.\\nNOTE 2: ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES\\nAcquisitions\\nDuring 2022, our Company’s acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $73\\xa0million. During 2021, our Company’s acquisitions\\nof businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $4,766 million, which primarily related to the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in\\nBA Sports Nutrition, LLC (“BodyArmor”). During 2020, our Company’s acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $1,052\\nmillion, which primarily related to the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in fairlife, LLC (“fairlife”).\\nBA Sports Nutrition, LLC\\nIn November 2021, the Company acquired the remaining 85 percent ownership interest in, and now owns 100 percent of, BodyArmor, which offers a line of sports performance\\nand hydration beverages in the United States. We acquired the remaining ownership interest in exchange for approximately $5,600\\xa0million of cash, of which $4,745 million was\\npaid at close, net of cash acquired. The purchase price reflected the contractual discount included in the purchase option we obtained with our initial investment in 2018. The\\nremaining $860 million of the purchase price was held back related to indemnification obligations, of which $540 million was included in the line item accounts payable and\\naccrued expenses and $320 million was included in the line item other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31,\\n2022, $549 million of the $860 million had been paid and $311 million remained in the line item accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet.\\nUpon consolidation, we recognized a gain of $834\\xa0million resulting from the remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in BodyArmor to fair value. The fair value of\\nour previously held equity interest was determined using a discounted cash flow model based on Level 3 inputs, as defined in Note 16. The gain was recorded in the line item\\nother income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income. Upon finalization of purchase accounting, $4.2 billion of the purchase price was allocated to the\\nBodyArmor trademark and $2.2 billion was allocated to goodwill, of which $1.2 billion is tax deductible. The goodwill recognized as part of this acquisition is primarily related\\nto the synergistic value created from leveraging the capabilities, assets and scale of the Company and the opportunity for international expansion. It also includes certain other\\nintangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, such as an assembled workforce. Of the total amount allocated to goodwill, $1.9 billion has been assigned to the\\nNorth America operating segment and $0.3 billion has been assigned to our other geographic operating segments.\\n72\\nfairlife, LLC\\nIn January 2020, the Company acquired the remaining 57.5 percent ownership interest in, and now owns 100 percent of, fairlife. fairlife offers a broad portfolio of products in\\nthe value-added dairy category across North America. Upon consolidation, we recognized a gain of $902 million resulting from the remeasurement of our previously held\\nequity interest in fairlife to fair value. The fair value of our previously held equity interest was determined using a discounted cash flow model based on Level 3 inputs, as\\ndefined in Note 16. The gain was recorded in the line item other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income. We acquired the remaining ownership interest in\\nexchange for $979 million of cash, net of cash acquired, and effectively settled our $306 million note receivable from fairlife at the recorded amount. Under the terms of the\\nagreement, we are subject to making future milestone payments which are contingent on fairlife achieving certain financial targets through 2024 and, if achieved, are payable in\\n2021, 2023 and 2025. These milestone payments are based on agreed-upon formulas related to fairlife’s operating results, the resulting values of which are not subject to a\\nceiling. Under the applicable accounting guidance, we recorded a $270 million liability representing our best estimate of the fair value of this contingent consideration as of the\\nacquisition date. The fair value of this contingent consideration was determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model based on Level 3 inputs, including management’s latest\\nestimates of future operating results. We are required to remeasure this liability to fair value quarterly, with any changes in the fair value recorded in income until the final\\nmilestone payment is made. Upon finalization of purchase accounting, $1.3\\xa0billion of the purchase price was allocated to the fairlife trademark and $0.8\\xa0billion was allocated to\\ngoodwill. The goodwill recognized as part of this acquisition is primarily related to synergistic value created from the opportunity for additional expansion. It also includes\\ncertain other intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, such as an assembled workforce. The goodwill is not tax deductible and has been assigned to the\\nNorth America operating segment.\\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded charges of $1,000 million, $369 million and $51\\xa0million, respectively. These charges related to the\\nremeasurement of the contingent consideration liability to fair value and were recorded in the line item other operating charges in our consolidated statements of income.\\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we made the first milestone payment of $100 million based on fairlife meeting its financial targets in 2020.\\nDivestitures\\nDuring 2022, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $458\\xa0million, which primarily related to the refranchising\\nof our bottling operations in Cambodia. We received net cash proceeds of $228\\xa0million and recognized a net gain of $153\\xa0million as a result of the refranchising. Also included\\nwas the sale of our ownership interest in one of our equity method investees, for which we received cash proceeds of $123\\xa0million and recognized a net gain of $13\\xa0million.\\nDuring 2021, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $2,180\\xa0million, which primarily related to the sale of our\\nownership interest in Coca-Cola Amatil Limited (“CCA”), an equity method investee, to Coca-Cola Europacific Partners plc (“CCEP”), also an equity method investee. We\\nreceived cash proceeds of $1,738 million and recognized a net gain of $695 million as a result of the sale and the related reversal of cumulative translation adjustments. Also\\nincluded were the sale of our ownership interest in an equity method investee and the sale of a portion of our ownership interest in another equity method investee. We received\\ncash proceeds of $293 million and recognized a net gain of $114 million as a result of these sales.\\nDuring 2020, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $189\\xa0million, which primarily related to the sale of our\\nownership interest in Piedmont Coca-Cola Bottling Partnership to Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc., an equity method investee. We received cash proceeds of $100 million and\\nrecognized a net loss of $2 million as a result of this sale. Also included were the sale of our ownership interest in an equity method investee and the sale of a portion of our\\nownership interest in another equity method investee. We received cash proceeds of $62\\xa0million and recognized a net gain of $35 million as a result of these sales.\\nAll of the gains and losses discussed above were recorded in the line item other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statements of income.\\nAssets and Liabilities Held for Sale\\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company’s bottling operations in Vietnam and Cambodia met the criteria to be classified as held for sale. As a result, we were required to record\\ntheir assets and liabilities at the lower of carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell. As the fair value less any costs to sell exceeded the carrying value, the related assets\\nand liabilities were recorded at their carrying value. These assets and liabilities were included in the Bottling Investments operating segment.\\nThe Company refranchised its bottling operations in Cambodia in November 2022. In December 2022, the Company received cash proceeds of $823 million in advance of\\nrefranchising its bottling operations in Vietnam. This advance was included in the\\n73\\nline item accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022, and was included in the line item other investing activities in our\\nconsolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company refranchised its bottling operations in Vietnam in January 2023.\\nThe following table presents information related to the major classes of assets and liabilities that were classified as held for sale and were included in the line items prepaid\\nexpenses and other current assets and accounts payable and accrued expenses, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets (in millions):\\nDecember 31,\\n2022\\n2021\\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments\\n$\\n229\\xa0 $\\n228\\xa0\\nTrade accounts receivable, less allowances\\n12\\xa0\\n21\\xa0\\nInventories\\n50\\xa0\\n55\\xa0\\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\\n43\\xa0\\n36\\xa0\\nOther noncurrent assets\\n29\\xa0\\n9\\xa0\\nDeferred income tax assets\\n8\\xa0\\n6\\xa0\\nProperty, plant and equipment — net\\n197\\xa0\\n282\\xa0\\nGoodwill\\n34\\xa0\\n37\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0Assets held for sale\\n$\\n602\\xa0 $\\n674\\xa0\\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\\n$\\n154\\xa0 $\\n139\\xa0\\nAccrued income taxes\\n3\\xa0\\n4\\xa0\\nOther noncurrent liabilities\\n3\\xa0\\n9\\xa0\\nDeferred income tax liabilities\\n—\\xa0\\n5\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0Liabilities held for sale\\n$\\n160\\xa0 $\\n157\\xa0\\nNOTE 3: NET OPERATING REVENUES\\nOur Company markets, manufactures and sells:\\n• beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as “beverage bases,” and syrups, including fountain syrups (we refer to this part of our business as our “concentrate\\noperations”); and\\n• finished sparkling soft drinks and other beverages (we refer to this part of our business as our “finished product operations”).\\nGenerally, finished product operations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations.\\nOur concentrate operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates, syrups and certain finished beverages to authorized bottling operations (to which\\nwe typically refer as our “bottlers” or our “bottling partners”). Our bottling partners either combine concentrates with still or sparkling water and sweeteners (depending on the\\nproduct), or combine syrups with still or sparkling water, to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers, such as cans and\\nrefillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles, bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us\\xa0and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, through\\nwholesalers or other bottlers. In addition, outside the United States, our bottling partners are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, using our concentrates, which\\nthey sell to fountain retailers for use in producing beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain\\nsyrups to fountain retailers. Our concentrate operations are included in our geographic operating segments and our Global Ventures operating segment.\\nOur finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling soft drinks and a variety of other finished beverages to retailers, or to distributors and\\nwholesalers who in turn sell the beverages to retailers. These operations consist primarily of our consolidated bottling and distribution operations, which are included in our\\nBottling Investments operating segment. In certain markets, the Company also operates non-bottling finished product operations in which we sell finished beverages to\\ndistributors and wholesalers that are generally not one of the Company’s bottling partners. These operations are generally included in one of our geographic operating segments\\nor our Global Ventures operating segment. Additionally, we sell directly to consumers through retail stores operated by Costa. These sales are included in our Global Ventures\\noperating segment. In the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers, who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate\\nconsumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who in turn sell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. These fountain syrup sales are included in our\\nNorth America operating segment.\\n74\\nRevenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contracts with our customers are satisfied. Our performance obligation generally consists of the\\npromise to sell concentrates, syrups or finished products to our bottling partners, wholesalers, distributors or retailers. Control of the concentrates, syrups or finished products is\\ntransferred upon shipment to, or receipt at, our customers’ locations, as determined by the specific terms of the contract. Upon transfer of control to the customer, which\\ncompletes our performance obligation, revenue is recognized. Our sales terms generally do not allow for a right of return except for matters related to any manufacturing\\ndefects on our part. After completion of our performance obligation, we have an unconditional right to consideration as outlined in the contract. Our receivables will generally\\nbe collected in less than six months, in accordance with the underlying payment terms. All of our performance obligations under the terms of contracts with our customers have\\nan original duration of one year or less.\\nOur customers and bottling partners may be entitled to cash discounts, funds for promotional and marketing activities, volume-based incentive programs, support for\\ninfrastructure programs and other similar programs. In most markets, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned\\nfinancial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers’ always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model.\\nUnder this model, the price we charge bottlers for concentrates they use to prepare and package finished products is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited\\nto, the prices charged by the bottlers for such finished products, the channels in which they are sold, and package mix. The amounts associated with the arrangements described\\nabove represent variable consideration, an estimate of which is included in the transaction price as a component of net operating revenues in our consolidated statement of\\nincome upon completion of our performance obligations. The total revenue recorded, including any variable consideration, cannot exceed the amount for which it is probable\\nthat a significant reversal will not occur when uncertainties related to variability are resolved. As a result, we are recognizing revenue based on our faithful depiction of the\\nconsideration that we expect to receive. In making our estimates of variable consideration, we consider past results and make significant assumptions related to: (1) customer\\nsales volumes; (2) customer ending inventories; (3) customer selling price per unit; (4) selling channels; and (5) discount rates, rebates and other pricing allowances, as\\napplicable. In gathering data to estimate our variable consideration, we generally calculate our estimates using a portfolio approach at the country and product line level rather\\nthan at the individual contract level. The result of making these estimates will impact the line items trade accounts receivable or accounts payable and accrued expenses in our\\nconsolidated balance sheet, as applicable. The actual amounts ultimately paid and/or received may be different from our estimates. The change in the amount of variable\\nconsideration recognized during the year ended December\\xa031, 2022 related to performance obligations satisfied in prior periods was immaterial.\\nThe following table presents net operating revenues disaggregated between the United States and International and further by line of business (in millions):\\nUnited States\\nInternational\\nTotal\\nYear Ended December 31, 2022\\nConcentrate operations\\n$\\n7,702\\xa0 $\\n16,369\\xa0 $\\n24,071\\xa0\\nFinished product operations\\n7,711\\xa0\\n11,222\\xa0\\n18,933\\xa0\\nTotal\\n$\\n15,413\\xa0 $\\n27,591\\xa0 $\\n43,004\\xa0\\nYear Ended December 31, 2021\\nConcentrate operations\\n$\\n6,551\\xa0 $\\n15,248\\xa0 $\\n21,799\\xa0\\nFinished product operations\\n6,459\\xa0\\n10,397\\xa0\\n16,856\\xa0\\nTotal\\n$\\n13,010\\xa0 $\\n25,645\\xa0 $\\n38,655\\xa0\\nYear Ended December 31, 2020\\nConcentrate operations\\n$\\n5,443\\xa0 $\\n13,139\\xa0 $\\n18,582\\xa0\\nFinished product operations\\n5,838\\xa0\\n8,594\\xa0\\n14,432\\xa0\\nTotal\\n$\\n11,281\\xa0 $\\n21,733\\xa0 $\\n33,014\\xa0\\nRefer to Note\\xa019 for additional revenue disclosures by operating segment and Corporate.\\n75\\nNOTE 4: INVESTMENTS\\nWe measure all equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value with the change in fair value included in\\nnet income. We use quoted market prices to determine the fair values of equity securities with readily determinable fair values. For equity securities without readily\\ndeterminable fair values, we have elected the measurement alternative under which we measure these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes\\nresulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Management assesses each of these investments on\\nan individual basis.\\nOur investments in debt securities are carried at either amortized cost or fair value. The cost basis is determined by the specific identification method. Investments in debt\\nsecurities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost and classified as held-to-maturity. Investments in debt securities\\nthat are not classified as held-to-maturity are carried at fair value and classified as either trading or available-for-sale. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading debt\\nsecurities as well as realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are included in net income. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on available-for-sale debt\\nsecurities are included in our consolidated balance sheet as a component of AOCI, except for the changes in fair values attributable to the currency risk being hedged, if\\napplicable, which are included in net income. Refer to Note\\xa05 for additional information related to the Company’s fair value hedges of available-for-sale debt securities.\\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity method and debt securities classified as trading are not assessed for\\nimpairment, since they are carried at fair value with the change in fair value included in net income. Equity method investments, equity securities without readily determinable\\nfair values and debt securities classified as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity are reviewed each reporting period to determine whether a significant event or change in\\ncircumstances has occurred that may have an adverse effect on the fair value of each investment. When such events or changes occur, we evaluate the fair value compared to\\nour cost basis in the investment. We also perform this evaluation every reporting period for each investment for which our cost basis has exceeded the fair value. The fair values\\nof most of our Company’s investments in publicly traded companies are often readily available based on quoted market prices. For investments in nonpublicly traded\\ncompanies, management’s assessment of fair value is based on various valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds, and appraisals, as\\nappropriate. We consider the assumptions that we believe a market participant would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or\\nestimates of sales proceeds valuation methodologies. The ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in emerging and developing markets, may impact the\\ndetermination of fair value. In the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other\\nthan temporary. If management determines the decline is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. Management’s assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair\\nvalue is based on, among other things, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis; the financial condition and near-term\\nprospects of the issuer; and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.\\nEquity Securities\\nThe carrying values of our equity securities were included in the following line items in our consolidated balance sheets (in millions):\\nFair Value with Changes\\nRecognized in Income\\nMeasurement Alternative\\n—\\nNo Readily Determinable\\nFair Value\\nDecember 31, 2022\\nMarketable securities\\n$\\n308\\xa0 $\\n—\\xa0\\nOther investments\\n459\\xa0\\n42\\xa0\\nOther noncurrent assets\\n1,303\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\nTotal equity securities\\n$\\n2,070\\xa0 $\\n42\\xa0\\nDecember 31, 2021\\nMarketable securities\\n$\\n376\\xa0 $\\n—\\xa0\\nOther investments\\n771\\xa0\\n47\\xa0\\nOther noncurrent assets\\n1,576\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\nTotal equity securities\\n$\\n2,723\\xa0 $\\n47\\xa0\\n76\\nThe calculation of net unrealized gains and losses recognized during the year related to equity securities still held at the end of the year is as follows (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2022\\n2021\\nNet gains (losses) recognized during the year related to equity securities\\n$\\n(236) $\\n509\\xa0\\nLess: Net gains (losses) recognized during the year related to equity securities sold during\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0the year\\n7\\xa0\\n71\\xa0\\nNet unrealized gains (losses) recognized during the year related to equity securities still held at\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0the end of the year\\n$\\n(243) $\\n438\\xa0\\nDebt Securities\\nOur debt securities consisted of the following (in millions):\\nGross Unrealized\\nEstimated Fair Value\\nCost\\nGains\\nLosses\\nDecember 31, 2022\\nTrading securities\\n$\\n43\\xa0 $\\n—\\xa0 $\\n(4) $\\n39\\xa0\\nAvailable-for-sale securities\\n979\\xa0\\n26\\xa0\\n(61)\\n944\\xa0\\nTotal debt securities\\n$\\n1,022\\xa0 $\\n26\\xa0 $\\n(65) $\\n983\\xa0\\nDecember 31, 2021\\nTrading securities\\n$\\n39\\xa0 $\\n1\\xa0 $\\n—\\xa0 $\\n40\\xa0\\nAvailable-for-sale securities\\n1,648\\xa0\\n33\\xa0\\n(132)\\n1,549\\xa0\\nTotal debt securities\\n$\\n1,687\\xa0 $\\n34\\xa0 $\\n(132) $\\n1,589\\xa0\\nThe carrying values of our debt securities were included in the following line items in our consolidated balance sheets (in millions):\\nDecember 31, 2022\\nDecember 31, 2021\\nTrading Securities\\nAvailable-for-Sale\\nSecurities\\nTrading Securities\\nAvailable-for-Sale\\nSecurities\\nMarketable securities\\n$\\n39\\xa0 $\\n722\\xa0\\n$\\n40\\xa0 $\\n1,283\\xa0\\nOther noncurrent assets\\n—\\xa0\\n222\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n266\\xa0\\nTotal debt securities\\n$\\n39\\xa0 $\\n944\\xa0\\n$\\n40\\xa0 $\\n1,549\\xa0\\nThe contractual maturities of these available-for-sale debt securities as of December\\xa031, 2022 were as follows (in millions):\\nCost\\nEstimated\\nFair Value\\nWithin 1\\xa0year\\n$\\n146\\xa0 $\\n145\\xa0\\nAfter 1\\xa0year through 5\\xa0years\\n621\\xa0\\n598\\xa0\\nAfter 5\\xa0years through 10\\xa0years\\n38\\xa0\\n49\\xa0\\nAfter 10\\xa0years\\n174\\xa0\\n152\\xa0\\nTotal\\n$\\n979\\xa0 $\\n944\\xa0\\nThe Company expects that actual maturities may differ from the contractual maturities above because borrowers have the right to call or prepay certain obligations.\\nThe sale and/or maturity of available-for-sale debt securities resulted in the following realized activity (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2022\\n2021\\n2020\\nGross gains\\n$\\n5\\xa0 $\\n6\\xa0 $\\n20\\xa0\\nGross losses\\n(136)\\n(10)\\n(13)\\nProceeds\\n1,498\\xa0\\n1,197\\xa0\\n1,559\\xa0\\n77\\nCaptive Insurance Companies\\nIn accordance with local insurance regulations, our consolidated captive insurance companies are required to meet and maintain minimum solvency capital requirements.

This captive’s solvency capital funds included total equity and debt securities of $1,378\\xa0million and $1,670\\xa0million as of December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021,\\nrespectively, which were classified in the line item other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheets because the assets were not available to satisfy our current\\nobligations.\\nNOTE 5: HEDGING TRANSACTIONS AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\\nThe Company is directly and indirectly affected by changes in certain market conditions. These changes in market conditions may adversely impact the Company’s financial\\nperformance and are referred to as “market risks.” When deemed appropriate, our Company uses derivatives as a risk management tool to mitigate the potential impact of\\ncertain market risks. The primary market risks managed by the Company through the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments are foreign currency exchange\\nrate risk, commodity price risk and interest rate risk.\\nThe Company uses various types of derivative instruments, including, but not limited to, forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option contracts, collars and swaps.\\nForward contracts and commodity futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined future date and at a predetermined\\nrate or price. An option contract is an agreement that conveys the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a\\npredetermined rate or price during a period or at a time in the future. A collar is a strategy that uses a combination of options to limit the range of possible positive or negative\\nreturns on an underlying asset or liability to a specific range, or to protect expected future cash flows. To do this, an investor simultaneously buys a put option and sells (writes)\\na call option, or alternatively buys a call option and sells (writes) a put option. A swap agreement is a contract between two parties to exchange cash flows based on specified\\nunderlying notional amounts, assets and/or indices. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The Company may also designate certain non-\\nderivative instruments, such as our foreign currency denominated third-party debt, in hedging relationships.\\nAll derivative instruments are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily in the following line items, as applicable: prepaid expenses and other current\\nassets; other noncurrent assets; accounts payable and accrued expenses; and other noncurrent liabilities. The carrying values of the derivatives reflect the impact of legally\\nenforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparties, as applicable. These master netting agreements allow the Company to\\nnet settle positive and negative positions (assets and liabilities) arising from different transactions with the same counterparty.\\nThe accounting for gains and losses that result from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives have been designated and qualify as\\nhedging instruments and the type of hedging relationships. Derivatives can be designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign\\noperations. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that have been designated and qualify for fair value hedge accounting are recorded in the same line item in our\\nconsolidated statement of income as the changes in the fair values of the hedged items attributable to the risk being hedged. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that\\nhave been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations are recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into the line item in our\\nconsolidated statement of income in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period the hedged items affect earnings. Due to the high degree of effectiveness between\\nthe hedging instruments and the underlying exposures being hedged, fluctuations in the values of the derivative instruments are generally offset by changes in the fair values or\\ncash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that were not designated and/or did not qualify as hedging instruments are\\nimmediately recognized in earnings.\\nFor derivatives that will be accounted for as hedging instruments, the Company formally designates and documents, at inception, the financial instrument as a hedge of a\\nspecific underlying exposure, the risk management objective and the strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction. In addition, the Company formally assesses, both at the\\ninception and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the financial instruments used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the fair values or cash flows\\nof the related underlying exposures.\\nThe Company determines the fair values of its derivatives based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. Refer to Note\\xa016. The notional amounts\\nof the derivative financial instruments do not necessarily represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, therefore, are not a direct measure of our exposure to the financial\\nrisks described above. The amounts exchanged are calculated by reference to the notional amounts and by other terms of the derivatives, such as interest rates, foreign currency\\nexchange rates, commodity rates or other financial indices. The Company does not view the fair\\n78\\nvalues of its derivatives in isolation but rather in relation to the fair values or cash flows of the underlying hedged transactions or other exposures. Virtually all of our\\nderivatives are straightforward over-the-counter instruments with liquid markets.\\nThe following table presents the fair values of the Company’s derivative instruments that were designated and qualified as part of a hedging relationship (in millions):\\n\\xa0\\nFair Value\\nDerivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments\\nBalance Sheet Location\\nDecember 31,\\n2022\\nDecember 31,\\n2021\\nAssets:\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nForeign currency contracts\\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\\n$\\n126\\xa0 $\\n151\\xa0\\nForeign currency contracts\\nOther noncurrent assets\\n13\\xa0\\n27\\xa0\\nInterest rate contracts\\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\\n—\\xa0\\n1\\xa0\\nInterest rate contracts\\nOther noncurrent assets\\n—\\xa0\\n282\\xa0\\nTotal assets\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n139\\xa0 $\\n461\\xa0\\nLiabilities:\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nForeign currency contracts\\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\\n$\\n54\\xa0 $\\n15\\xa0\\nForeign currency contracts\\nOther noncurrent liabilities\\n108\\xa0\\n17\\xa0\\nCommodity contracts\\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\\n2\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\nInterest rate contracts\\nOther noncurrent liabilities\\n1,676\\xa0\\n14\\xa0\\nTotal liabilities\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n1,840\\xa0 $\\n46\\xa0\\nAll of the Company’s derivative instruments are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets after considering the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash\\ncollateral held or placed with the same counterparties, as applicable.

We monitor counterparty\\nexposures regularly and review any downgrade in credit rating immediately. If a downgrade in the credit rating of a counterparty were to occur, we have provisions requiring\\ncollateral for substantially all of our transactions. To mitigate presettlement risk, minimum credit standards become more stringent as the duration of the derivative financial\\ninstrument increases. In addition, the Company’s master netting agreements reduce credit risk by permitting the Company to net settle for transactions with the same\\ncounterparty. To minimize the concentration of credit risk, we enter into derivative transactions with a portfolio of financial institutions. Furthermore, for certain derivative\\nfinancial instruments, the Company has agreements with counterparties that require collateral to be exchanged based on changes in the fair value of the instruments. The\\nCompany classifies collateral payments and receipts as investing cash flows when the collateral account is in an asset position and as financing cash flows when the collateral\\naccount is in a liability position. As a result of these factors, we consider the risk of counterparty default to be minimal.\\nCash Flow Hedging Strategy\\nThe Company uses cash flow hedges to minimize the variability in cash flows of assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions caused by fluctuations in foreign currency\\nexchange rates, commodity prices or interest rates. The changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into\\nthe line item in our consolidated statement of income in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period the hedged items affect earnings. The changes in fair values of\\nhedges that are determined to be ineffective are immediately reclassified from AOCI into earnings. The maximum length of time for which the Company hedges its exposure to\\nthe variability in future cash flows is typically three years.\\nThe Company maintains a foreign currency cash flow hedging program to reduce the risk that our U.S. dollar net cash inflows from sales outside the United States and U.S.\\ndollar net cash outflows from procurement activities will be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into forward contracts and purchase\\nforeign currency options and collars (principally euro, British pound sterling and Japanese yen) to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign\\ncurrencies. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against the foreign currencies, the decline in the present value of future foreign currency cash flows is partially offset by gains in\\nthe fair value of the derivative instruments. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar weakens, the increase in the present value of future foreign currency cash flows is partially offset\\nby losses in the fair value of the derivative instruments. The total notional values of derivatives that were designated and qualified for the Company’s foreign currency cash\\nflow hedging program were $5,510 million and $7,399 million as of December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\\nThe Company uses cross-currency swaps to hedge the changes in cash flows of certain of its foreign currency denominated debt and other monetary assets or liabilities due to\\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates.\\xa0For this hedging program, the Company recognizes in earnings each period the changes in carrying values of these foreign currency\\ndenominated assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in exchange rates. The changes in fair values of the cross-currency swap derivatives are recorded in AOCI with an\\nimmediate reclassification into earnings for the changes in fair values attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The total notional values of derivatives that\\nwere designated as cash flow hedges for the Company’s foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities were $958 million and $1,994 million as of December\\xa031, 2022 and\\n2021, respectively.\\nThe Company has entered into commodity futures contracts and other derivative instruments on various commodities to mitigate the price risk associated with forecasted\\npurchases of materials used in our manufacturing process. These derivative instruments were designated as part of the Company’s commodity cash flow hedging program. The\\nobjective of this hedging program is to reduce the variability of cash flows associated with future purchases of certain commodities. The total notional values of derivatives that\\nwere designated and qualified for this program were $35 million and $10 million as of December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\\nOur Company monitors our mix of short-term debt and long-term debt regularly. From time to time, we manage our risk to interest rate fluctuations through the use of\\nderivative financial instruments. The Company has entered into interest rate swap agreements and has designated these instruments as part of the Company’s interest rate cash\\nflow hedging program. The objective of this hedging program is to mitigate the risk of adverse changes in benchmark interest rates on the Company’s future interest payments.\\nThere were no interest rate swap agreements that were designated and qualified for the Company’s interest rate cash flow hedging program as of December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021.\\n80\\nThe following table presents the pretax impact that changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges had on other comprehensive income (“OCI”), AOCI\\nand earnings (in millions):\\nGain (Loss)\\nRecognized\\nin OCI\\nLocation of Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income\\nGain (Loss)\\nReclassified from\\nAOCI into Income\\n2022\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nForeign currency contracts\\n$\\n205\\xa0\\nNet operating revenues\\n$\\n218\\xa0\\nForeign currency contracts\\n17\\xa0\\nCost of goods sold\\n28\\xa0\\nForeign currency contracts\\n—\\xa0\\nInterest expense\\n(4)\\nForeign currency contracts\\n(91)\\nOther income (loss) — net\\n(79)\\nCommodity contracts\\n(4)\\nCost of goods sold\\n(2)\\nTotal\\n$\\n127\\xa0\\n$\\n161\\xa0\\n2021\\nForeign currency contracts\\n$\\n36\\xa0\\nNet operating revenues\\n$\\n(77)\\nForeign currency contracts\\n(2)\\nCost of goods sold\\n(10)\\nForeign currency contracts\\n—\\xa0\\nInterest expense\\n(13)\\nForeign currency contracts\\n19\\xa0\\nOther income (loss) — net\\n74\\xa0\\nInterest rate contracts\\n110\\xa0\\nInterest expense\\n(90)\\nCommodity contracts\\n(1)\\nCost of goods sold\\n—\\xa0\\nTotal\\n$\\n162\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n(116)\\n2020\\nForeign currency contracts\\n$\\n(93)\\nNet operating revenues\\n$\\n(73)\\nForeign currency contracts\\n4\\xa0\\nCost of goods sold\\n9\\xa0\\nForeign currency contracts\\n—\\xa0\\nInterest expense\\n(16)\\nForeign currency contracts\\n37\\xa0\\nOther income (loss) — net\\n60\\xa0\\nInterest rate contracts\\n15\\xa0\\nInterest expense\\n(54)\\nCommodity contracts\\n2\\xa0\\nCost of goods sold\\n—\\xa0\\nTotal\\n$\\n(35)\\n$\\n(74)\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2022, the Company estimates that it will reclassify into earnings during the next 12\\xa0months net gains of $56\\xa0million from the pretax amount recorded in\\nAOCI as the anticipated cash flows occur.\\nFair Value Hedging Strategy\\nThe Company uses interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges to minimize exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt that result from\\nfluctuations in benchmark interest rates. The Company also uses cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge the changes in the fair value of foreign currency denominated debt\\nrelating to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and benchmark interest rates. The changes in fair values of derivatives designated as fair value hedges and the\\noffsetting changes in fair values of the hedged items are recognized in earnings. As a result, any difference is reflected in earnings as ineffectiveness. When a derivative is no\\nlonger designated as a fair value hedge for any reason, including termination and maturity, the remaining unamortized difference between the carrying value of the hedged item\\nat that time and the face value of the hedged item is amortized to earnings over the remaining life of the hedged item, or immediately if the hedged item has matured or has\\nbeen extinguished. The total notional values of derivatives that were designated and qualified as fair value hedges of this type were $13,425 million and $12,113 million as of\\nDecember\\xa031, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\\n81\\nThe following table summarizes the pretax impact that changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as fair value hedges had on earnings (in millions):\\nHedging Instruments and Hedged Items\\nLocation of Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income\\nGain (Loss)\\nRecognized in Income\\n2022\\nInterest rate contracts\\nInterest expense\\n$\\n(1,944)\\nFixed-rate debt\\nInterest expense\\n1,927\\xa0\\nNet impact of fair value hedging instruments\\n$\\n(17)\\n2021\\nInterest rate contracts\\nInterest expense\\n$\\n(67)\\nFixed-rate debt\\nInterest expense\\n66\\xa0\\n\\xa0Net impact of fair value hedging instruments\\n$\\n(1)\\n2020\\nInterest rate contracts\\nInterest expense\\n$\\n275\\xa0\\nFixed-rate debt\\nInterest expense\\n(274)\\nNet impact to interest expense\\n$\\n1\\xa0\\nForeign currency contracts\\nOther income (loss) — net\\n$\\n(4)\\nAvailable-for-sale securities\\nOther income (loss) — net\\n5\\xa0\\nNet impact to other income (loss) — net\\n$\\n1\\xa0\\nNet impact of fair value hedging instruments\\n$\\n2\\xa0\\nThe following table summarizes the amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets related to hedged items in fair value hedging relationships (in millions):\\nCumulative Amount of Fair Value Hedging Adjustments\\nCarrying Values of\\nHedged Items\\nIncluded in the Carrying Values of Hedged\\nItems\\nRemaining for Which Hedge Accounting Has\\nBeen Discontinued\\nBalance Sheet Location of Hedged Items\\nDecember 31,\\n2022\\nDecember 31,\\n2021\\nDecember 31,\\n2022\\nDecember 31,\\n2021\\nDecember 31,\\n2022\\nDecember 31,\\n2021\\nCurrent maturities of long-term debt\\n$\\n—\\xa0 $\\n200\\xa0\\n$\\n—\\xa0 $\\n1\\xa0\\n$\\n—\\xa0 $\\n—\\xa0\\nLong-term debt\\n11,900\\xa0\\n12,353\\xa0\\n(1,664)\\n255\\xa0\\n195\\xa0\\n228\\xa0\\nCumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments does not include changes due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\\nHedges of Net Investments in Foreign Operations Strategy\\nThe Company uses forward contracts and a portion of its foreign currency denominated debt, a non-derivative financial instrument, to protect the value of our net investments\\nin a number of foreign operations. For derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations, the changes in the fair\\nvalues of the derivative financial instruments are recognized in net foreign currency translation adjustments, a component of AOCI, to offset the changes in the values of the net\\ninvestments being hedged. For non-derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations, the changes in the\\ncarrying values of the designated portions of the non-derivative financial instruments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are recorded in net foreign currency\\ntranslation adjustments. Any ineffective portions of net investment hedges are reclassified from AOCI into earnings during the period of change.\\n1\\n1 \\n82\\nThe following table summarizes the notional values and pretax impact of changes in the fair values of instruments designated as net investment hedges (in millions):\\nNotional Values\\nGain (Loss) Recognized in OCI\\nas of December 31,\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n\\xa0\\n2022\\n2021\\n2022\\n2021\\n2020\\nForeign currency contracts\\n$\\n—\\xa0 $\\n40\\xa0\\n$\\n(10) $\\n(10) $\\n(5)\\nForeign currency denominated debt\\n12,061\\xa0\\n12,812\\xa0\\n751\\xa0\\n928\\xa0\\n(1,089)\\nTotal\\n$\\n12,061\\xa0 $\\n12,852\\xa0\\n$\\n741\\xa0 $\\n918\\xa0 $\\n(1,094)\\nThe Company reclassified a loss of $4 million related to net investment hedges from AOCI into earnings during the year ended December\\xa031, 2021. The Company did not\\nreclassify any gains or losses related to net investment hedges from AOCI into earnings during the years ended December\\xa031, 2022 and 2020. In addition, the Company did not\\nhave any ineffectiveness related to net investment hedges during the years ended December\\xa031, 2022, 2021 and 2020. The cash inflows and outflows associated with the\\nCompany’s derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges are classified in the line item other investing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows.\\nEconomic (Non-Designated) Hedging Strategy\\nIn addition to derivative instruments that were designated and qualified for hedge accounting, the Company also uses certain derivatives as economic hedges of foreign\\ncurrency, interest rate and commodity exposure. Although these derivatives were not designated and/or did not qualify for hedge accounting, they are effective economic\\nhedges. The changes in the fair values of economic hedges are immediately recognized in earnings.\\nThe Company uses foreign currency economic hedges to offset the earnings impact that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have on certain monetary assets and\\nliabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies. The changes in the fair values of economic hedges used to offset those monetary assets and liabilities are immediately\\nrecognized in earnings in the line item other income (loss)\\xa0— net in our consolidated statement of income. In addition, we use foreign currency economic hedges to minimize\\nthe variability in cash flows associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including those related to certain acquisition and divestiture activities. The changes\\nin the fair values of economic hedges used to offset the variability in U.S. dollar net cash flows are immediately recognized in earnings in the line items net operating revenues,\\ncost of goods sold or other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income, as applicable. The total notional values of derivatives related to our foreign currency\\neconomic hedges were $4,902 million\\xa0and $4,258 million as of December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\\nThe Company uses interest rate contracts as economic hedges to minimize exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt that result from fluctuations in benchmark\\ninterest rates. The total notional value of derivatives related to our economic hedges of this type was $200 million as of December\\xa031, 2021. There were no interest rate\\ncontracts used as economic hedges as of December\\xa031, 2022.\\nThe Company also uses certain derivatives as economic hedges to mitigate the price risk associated with the purchase of materials used in the manufacturing process and\\nvehicle fuel. The changes in the fair values of these economic hedges are immediately recognized in earnings in the line items net operating revenues, cost of goods sold, or\\nselling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income, as applicable. The total notional values of derivatives related to our economic hedges of\\nthis type were $336\\xa0million and $908\\xa0million as of December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\\n83\\nThe following table presents the pretax impact that changes in the fair values of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments had on earnings (in millions):\\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments\\nLocation of Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income\\nGain (Loss) Recognized in Income\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2022\\n2021\\n2020\\nForeign currency contracts\\nNet operating revenues\\n$\\n(55) $\\n6\\xa0 $\\n58\\xa0\\nForeign currency contracts\\nCost of goods sold\\n46\\xa0\\n(10)\\n6\\xa0\\nForeign currency contracts\\nOther income (loss)\\xa0— net\\n57\\xa0\\n(84)\\n(13)\\nCommodity contracts\\nCost of goods sold\\n(40)\\n171\\xa0\\n54\\xa0\\nInterest rate contracts\\nInterest expense\\n—\\xa0\\n(187)\\n6\\xa0\\nOther derivative instruments\\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\\n(21)\\n34\\xa0\\n21\\xa0\\nOther derivative instruments\\nOther income (loss)\\xa0— net\\n—\\xa0\\n(3)\\n(55)\\nTotal\\n\\xa0 $\\n(13) $\\n(73) $\\n77\\xa0\\nNOTE 6: EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS\\nOur consolidated net income includes our Company’s proportionate share of the net income or loss of our equity method investees.

Refer\\nto Note\\xa01 for additional information related to the Company’s maximum exposure to loss due to our involvement with VIEs. Our guarantees are primarily related to third-party\\ncustomers, bottlers and vendors and arose through the normal course of business. These guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees is individually significant.\\nThese amounts represent the maximum potential future payments that we could be required to make under the guarantees. However, management has concluded that the\\nlikelihood of any significant amounts being paid by our Company under these guarantees is not probable.\\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\\nWe believe our exposure to concentrations of credit risk is limited due to the diverse geographic areas covered by our operations.\\nLegal Contingencies\\nThe Company is involved in various legal proceedings. We establish reserves for specific legal proceedings when we determine that the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is\\nprobable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Management has also identified certain other legal matters where we believe an unfavorable outcome is\\nreasonably possible and/or for which no estimate of possible losses can be made. Management believes that the total liabilities of the Company that may arise as a result of\\ncurrently pending legal proceedings (excluding tax audit claims) will not have a material adverse effect on the Company taken as a whole.\\nIndemnifications\\nAt the time we acquire or divest an ownership interest in an entity, we sometimes agree to indemnify the seller or buyer for specific contingent liabilities. Management believes\\nthat any liability to the Company that may arise as a result of any such indemnification agreements will not have a material adverse effect on the Company taken as a whole.\\nTax Audits\\nThe Company is involved in various tax matters, with respect to some of which the outcome is uncertain. These uncertain tax matters may result in the assessment of additional\\ntaxes. Refer to Note\\xa014.\\nOn September 17, 2015, the Company received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (“Notice”) from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) seeking approximately $3.3\\nbillion of additional federal income tax for years 2007 through 2009. In the Notice, the IRS stated its intent to reallocate over $9\\xa0billion of income to the U.S. parent company\\nfrom certain of its foreign affiliates that the U.S. parent company licensed to manufacture, distribute, sell, market and promote its products in certain non-U.S. markets.\\nThe Notice concerned the Company’s transfer pricing between its U.S. parent company and certain of its foreign affiliates. IRS rules governing transfer pricing require arm’s-\\nlength pricing of transactions between related parties such as the Company’s U.S. parent and its foreign affiliates.\\nTo resolve the same transfer pricing issue for the tax years 1987 through 1995, the Company and the IRS had agreed in 1996 on an arm’s-length methodology for determining\\nthe amount of U.S. taxable income that the U.S. parent company would report as compensation from its foreign licensees. The Company and the IRS memorialized this accord\\nin a closing agreement resolving that dispute (“Closing Agreement”). The Closing Agreement provided that, absent a change in material facts or circumstances or relevant\\nfederal tax law, in calculating the Company’s income taxes going forward, the Company would not be assessed penalties by the IRS for using the agreed-upon tax calculation\\nmethodology that the Company and the IRS agreed would be used for the 1987 through 1995 tax years.\\nThe IRS audited and confirmed the Company’s compliance with the agreed-upon Closing Agreement methodology in five successive audit cycles for tax years 1996 through\\n2006.\\nThe September 17, 2015 Notice from the IRS retroactively rejected the previously agreed-upon methodology for the 2007 through 2009 tax years in favor of an entirely\\ndifferent methodology, without prior notice to the Company. Using the new tax calculation methodology, the IRS reallocated over $9 billion of income to the U.S. parent\\ncompany from its foreign licensees for tax years 2007 through 2009. Consistent with the Closing Agreement, the IRS did not assert penalties, and it has yet to do so.\\n90\\nThe IRS designated the Company’s matter for litigation on October 15, 2015. Litigation designation is an IRS determination that forecloses to a company any and all alternative\\nmeans for resolution of a tax dispute. As a result of the IRS’ designation of the Company’s matter for litigation, the Company was forced to either accept the IRS’ newly\\nimposed tax assessment and pay the full amount of the asserted tax or litigate the matter in the federal courts. The matter remains subject to the IRS’ litigation designation,\\npreventing the Company from any attempt to settle or otherwise mutually resolve the matter with the IRS.\\nThe Company consequently initiated litigation by filing a petition in the U.S. Tax Court (“Tax Court”) in December 2015, challenging the tax adjustments enumerated in the\\nNotice.\\nPrior to trial, the IRS increased its transfer pricing adjustment by $385\\xa0million, resulting in an additional tax adjustment of $135\\xa0million. The Company obtained a summary\\njudgment in its favor on a different matter related to Mexican foreign tax credits, which thereafter effectively reduced the IRS’ potential tax adjustment by $138\\xa0million.\\nThe trial was held in the Tax Court from March through May 2018, and final post-trial briefs were filed and exchanged in April 2019.\\nOn November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued an opinion (“Opinion”) in which it predominantly sided with the IRS but agreed with the Company that dividends previously paid\\nby the foreign licensees to the U.S. parent company in reliance upon the Closing Agreement should continue to be allowed to offset royalties, including those that would\\nbecome payable to the Company in accordance with the Opinion. The Tax Court reserved ruling on the effect of Brazilian legal restrictions on the payment of royalties by the\\nCompany’s licensee in Brazil until after the Tax Court issues its opinion in the separate case of 3M Co. & Subs. v. Commissioner, T.C. Docket No. 5816-13 (filed March 11,\\n2013). The Tax Court issued its opinion in 3M Co.’s case (“3M Co. opinion”) on February 9, 2023. Once the Tax Court completes its analysis of the application of the 3M Co.\\nopinion to the Company’s case, the Company expects the Tax Court to render another opinion, and ultimately a final decision, in the Company’s case.\\nThe Company believes that the IRS and the Tax Court misinterpreted and misapplied the applicable regulations in reallocating income earned by the Company’s foreign\\nlicensees to increase the Company’s U.S. tax. Moreover, the Company believes that the retroactive imposition of such tax liability using a calculation methodology different\\nfrom that previously agreed upon by the IRS and the Company, and audited by the IRS for over a decade, is unconstitutional. The Company intends to assert its claims on\\nappeal and vigorously defend its position.\\nIn determining the amount of tax reserve to be recorded as of December 31, 2020, the Company completed the required two-step evaluation process prescribed by Accounting\\nStandards Codification 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. In doing so, we consulted with outside advisors, and we reviewed and considered relevant laws, rules, and\\nregulations, including, but not limited to, the Opinion and relevant caselaw. We also considered our intention to vigorously defend our positions and assert our various well-\\nfounded legal claims via every available avenue of appeal. We concluded, based on the technical and legal merits of the Company’s tax positions, that it is more likely than not\\nthe Company’s tax positions will ultimately be sustained on appeal. In addition, we considered a number of alternative transfer pricing methodologies, including the\\nmethodology asserted by the IRS and affirmed in the Opinion (“Tax Court Methodology”), that could be applied by the courts upon final resolution of the litigation. Based on\\nthe required probability analysis, we determined the methodologies we believe the federal courts could ultimately order to be used in calculating the Company’s tax. As a result\\nof this analysis, we recorded a tax reserve of $438\\xa0million during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the application of the resulting methodologies as well as the\\ndifferent tax treatment applicable to dividends originally paid to the U.S. parent company by its foreign licensees, in reliance upon the Closing Agreement, that would be\\nrecharacterized as royalties in accordance with the Opinion and the Company’s analysis.\\nThe Company’s conclusion that it is more likely than not the Company’s tax positions will ultimately be sustained on appeal is unchanged as of December\\xa031, 2022. However,\\nwe updated our calculation of the methodologies we believe the federal courts could ultimately order to be used in calculating the Company’s tax. As a result of the application\\nof the required probability analysis to these updated calculations and the accrual of interest through the current reporting period, we updated our tax reserve as of December\\xa031,\\n2022 to $423\\xa0million.\\nWhile the Company strongly disagrees with the IRS’ positions and the portions of the Opinion affirming such positions, it is possible that some portion or all of the adjustment\\nproposed by the IRS and sustained by the Tax Court could ultimately be upheld. In that event, the Company would likely be subject to significant additional liabilities for tax\\nyears 2007 through 2009, and potentially also for subsequent years, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, and\\ncash flows.\\nThe Company calculated the potential impact of applying the Tax Court Methodology to reallocate income from foreign licensees potentially covered within the scope of the\\nOpinion, assuming such methodology were to be ultimately upheld by the courts, and the IRS were to decide to apply that methodology to subsequent years, with consent of the\\nfederal courts. This\\n91\\nimpact would include taxes and interest accrued through December\\xa031, 2022 for the 2007 through 2009 litigated tax years and for subsequent tax years from 2010 through\\n2022. The calculations incorporated the estimated impact of correlative adjustments to the previously accrued transition tax payable under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\\n(“Tax Reform Act”). The Company estimates that the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability could be approximately $14 billion as of December\\xa031, 2022.\\nAdditional income tax and interest would continue to accrue until the time any such potential liability, or portion thereof, were to be paid. We currently project the continued\\napplication of the Tax Court Methodology in future years, assuming similar facts and circumstances as of December\\xa031, 2022, would result in an incremental annual tax\\nliability that would increase the Company’s effective tax rate by approximately 3.5 percent.\\nThe Company does not know when the Tax Court will issue its opinion regarding the effect of Brazilian legal restrictions on the payment of royalties by the Company’s licensee\\nin Brazil for the 2007 through 2009 tax years. After the Tax Court issues its opinion on the Company’s Brazilian licensee, the Company and the IRS will be provided time to\\nagree on the tax impact, if any, of both opinions, after which the Tax Court would render a final decision in the case. The Company will have 90 days thereafter to file a notice\\nof appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit and pay the tax liability and interest related to the 2007 through 2009 tax years. The Company currently\\nestimates that the payment to be made at that time related to the 2007 through 2009 tax years, which is included in the above estimate of the potential aggregate incremental tax\\nand interest liability, would be approximately $5.2 billion (including interest accrued through December\\xa031, 2022), plus any additional interest accrued through the time of\\npayment. Some or all of this amount would be refunded if the Company were to prevail on appeal.\\nRisk Management Programs\\nThe Company has numerous global insurance programs in place to help protect the Company from the risk of loss. In general, we are self-insured for large portions of many\\ndifferent types of claims; however, we do use commercial insurance above our self-insured retentions to reduce the Company’s risk of catastrophic loss. Our reserves for the\\nCompany’s self-insured losses are estimated using actuarial methods and assumptions of the insurance industry, adjusted for our specific expectations based on our claims\\nhistory. Our self-insurance reserves totaled $199 million and $229 million as of December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\\nNOTE 12: STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS\\nOur Company grants long-term equity awards under its stock-based compensation plans to certain employees of the Company. The Coca-Cola Company 2014 Equity Plan\\n(“2014 Equity Plan”) was approved by shareowners in April 2014. Under the 2014 Equity Plan, a maximum of 500 million shares of our common stock was approved to be\\nissued through the grant of equity awards. The 2014 Equity Plan allows for grants of stock options, performance share units, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other\\nspecified award types, including cash awards with performance-based vesting criteria. As of December\\xa031, 2022, there were 308\\xa0million shares available to be granted under\\nthe 2014 Equity Plan. In addition, there were 3\\xa0million shares available for stock option and restricted stock award grants under plans approved by shareowners prior to 2014.\\nFrom 2015 to 2017, certain employees who had previously been eligible for long-term equity awards received long-term performance-based cash awards. Employees who\\nreceived these performance-based cash awards did not receive equity awards as part of the long-term incentive program. In 2017, the Company changed the long-term incentive\\nprogram for employees previously eligible for the performance-based cash award. These employees no longer participate in the long-term incentive program and were granted a\\nfinal restricted stock unit award that vests ratably over five years.\\nTotal stock-based compensation expense was $361 million, $337 million and $141 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In 2022, for certain employees who accepted\\nvoluntary separation from the Company as a result of the restructuring of our North America operating unit, the Company provided cash payments designed to offset the loss of\\ncertain equity awards and serve as a cash supplement to employees upon the exercise of certain stock options. In 2020, for certain employees who accepted voluntary separation\\nfrom the Company as a result of our strategic realignment initiatives, the Company modified their outstanding equity awards so that the employees retained all or some of their\\nawards, whereas otherwise the awards would have been forfeited. The incremental stock-based compensation expense in 2022 arising from the cash payments was $5\\xa0million,\\nand the incremental stock-based compensation expense in 2020 arising from the modification of awards was $15\\xa0million. These amounts were recorded in the line item other\\noperating charges in our consolidated statements of income. Refer to Note\\xa018 for additional information on the Company’s restructuring and strategic realignment initiatives.\\nThe remainder of stock-based compensation expense in 2022 and 2020 of $356\\xa0million and $126 million, respectively, and all stock-based compensation expense in 2021 were\\nrecorded in the line item selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income. The total income tax benefit recognized in our consolidated\\nstatements of income related to total stock-based compensation expense was $55 million, $60 million and $32\\xa0million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\\n92\\nAs of December\\xa031, 2022, we had $325 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock-based compensation awards granted under our plans, which\\nwe expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years as stock‑based compensation expense. This expected cost does not include the impact of any future stock-\\nbased compensation awards.\\nStock Option Awards\\nStock option awards are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the average of the high and low market prices per share of the Company’s stock on the grant date. The\\nfair value of each stock option award is estimated using a Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is\\ngenerally four years.\\nThe weighted-average fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December\\xa031, 2022, 2021 and 2020 and the weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-\\nScholes-Merton option-pricing model for such grants were as follows:\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2022\\n2021\\n2020\\nFair value of stock options on grant date\\n$\\n8.23\\xa0\\n$\\n5.08\\xa0\\n$\\n6.44\\xa0\\nDividend yield\\n2.8\\xa0%\\n3.3\\xa0%\\n2.7\\xa0%\\nExpected volatility\\n18.0\\xa0%\\n18.0\\xa0%\\n16.0\\xa0%\\nRisk-free interest rate\\n1.9\\xa0%\\n0.9\\xa0%\\n1.4\\xa0%\\nExpected term of stock options\\n6 years\\n6 years\\n6 years\\nThe dividend yield is the calculated yield on the closing market price per share of the Company’s stock on the grant date.\\nThe expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on the Company’s stock, historical volatility of the Company’s stock and other factors.\\nThe risk-free interest rate for the period matching the expected term of the stock options is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect on the grant date.\\nThe expected term of the stock options represents the period of time that stock options are expected to be outstanding and is derived by analyzing historical exercise behavior.\\nStock option awards generally expire 10 years after the grant date. The shares of common stock to be issued and/or sold upon the exercise of stock options are made available\\nfrom either authorized and unissued common stock or from treasury shares. Since 2007, the Company has issued common stock under its stock-based compensation plans from\\ntreasury shares.\\nStock option activity during the year ended December\\xa031, 2022 was as follows:\\nShares\\n(In millions)\\nWeighted-Average\\nExercise Price\\nWeighted-Average\\nRemaining\\nContractual Term\\nAggregate\\nIntrinsic Value\\n(In millions)\\nOutstanding on January\\xa01, 2022\\n75\\xa0 $\\n42.43\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nGranted\\n7\\xa0\\n61.35\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nExercised\\n(22)\\n38.75\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nForfeited/expired\\n(1)\\n52.96\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nOutstanding on December\\xa031, 2022\\n59\\xa0 $\\n45.93\\xa0\\n3.6 years $\\n1,035\\xa0\\nExpected to vest\\n58\\xa0 $\\n45.88\\xa0\\n4.6 years $\\n1,030\\xa0\\nExercisable on December\\xa031, 2022\\n43\\xa0 $\\n42.20\\xa0\\n3.3 years $\\n916\\xa0\\nThe total intrinsic value of the stock options exercised was $534 million, $358 million and $453 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The total number of stock options\\nexercised was 22 million, 19 million and 23 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\\nPerformance-Based Share Unit Awards\\nPerformance share unit awards require achievement of certain performance criteria, which are predefined by the Talent and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors\\nat the time of grant. For performance share unit awards granted from 2015 through 2017, the performance criteria were economic profit and net operating revenues over a\\npredefined performance period of three years. Economic profit is our net operating profit after tax less the cost of the capital used in our business. Economic profit and net\\noperating revenues were adjusted for certain items, which were approved by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The purpose of these adjustments was to ensure a\\nconsistent year-to-year comparison of the specific performance criteria. Most of these awards included a relative TSR modifier to determine the final number of performance\\nshare units earned. For these awards, the number of performance share units earned based on the certified achievement of the predefined\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n93\\nperformance criteria was reduced or increased if the Company’s total shareowner return over the performance period relative to a predefined compensation comparator group of\\ncompanies fell outside of a predefined range. The fair value of these performance share units was determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model. The performance share unit\\nawards granted from 2015 through 2017 were subject to a one-year holding period after the performance period before the shares were released.\\nFor performance share unit awards granted from 2018 through 2022, the performance criteria were equally weighted among net operating revenues, earnings per share and free\\ncash flow over a predefined performance period of three years. For performance share unit awards granted to executives in 2022, the performance criteria were weighted 30\\npercent for net operating revenues, 30 percent for earnings per share, 30 percent for free cash flow and 10 percent for environmental sustainability. For purposes of these\\nperformance criteria, earnings per share is diluted net income per share; free cash flow is net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and\\nequipment; and environmental sustainability is comprised of predefined goals related to the Company’s packaging and water security strategies. These performance criteria are\\nadjusted for certain items, if applicable, which are subject to Audit Committee approval. The purpose of these adjustments is to ensure a consistent year-to-year comparison of\\nthe specific performance criteria. Performance share unit awards granted to executives include a relative TSR modifier to determine the final number of performance share units\\nearned. The fair value of performance share units that include a TSR modifier is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model. For these awards, the number of\\nperformance share units earned based on the certified achievement of the predefined performance criteria will be reduced or increased if the Company’s total shareowner return\\nover the performance period relative to a predefined compensation comparator group of companies falls outside of a predefined range. The fair value of performance share units\\nthat do not include a TSR modifier is the closing market price per share of the Company’s stock on the grant date less the present value of the expected dividends not received\\nduring the performance period. The performance share unit awards will generally vest at the end of the respective performance period.\\nDuring 2021, in addition to granting performance share unit awards with a three-year performance period, the Company granted emerging stronger performance share unit\\nawards with a predefined performance period of two years. The award’s performance criterion was earnings per share, and the award included a relative TSR modifier. Earnings\\nper share for these purposes was diluted net income per share adjusted for certain items, which were approved by the Audit Committee. The purpose of these adjustments was\\nto ensure a consistent year-to-year comparison of the performance criterion. These performance share unit awards generally vested at the end of the two-year performance\\nperiod.\\nFor performance share unit awards, in the event the certified results equal the predefined performance criteria, the number of performance share units earned will be equal to\\nthe target award. In the event the certified results exceed the predefined performance criteria, additional performance share units up to the maximum award will be earned. In\\nthe event the certified results fall below the predefined performance criteria but are at or above the minimum threshold, a reduced number of performance share units will be\\nearned. If the certified results fall below the minimum threshold, no performance share units will be earned. Performance share unit awards do not entitle participants to vote or\\nreceive dividends until the performance share units are settled in stock.\\nIn the reporting period it becomes probable that the minimum performance threshold specified in the performance share unit award will be achieved, we recognize\\ncompensation expense for the proportionate share of the total fair value of the performance share units related to the vesting period that has already lapsed for the performance\\nshare units expected to vest. The remaining fair value of the performance share units expected to vest is expensed on a straight-line basis over the remainder of the vesting\\nperiod. In the event the Company determines it is no longer probable that the minimum performance threshold specified in the award will be achieved, we reverse all previously\\nrecognized compensation expense in the reporting period such a determination is made.\\nPerformance share units earned are generally settled in stock, except for certain circumstances such as death or disability, in which case beneficiaries or employees are provided\\ncash payments. As of December\\xa031, 2022, nonvested performance share units of approximately 1,949,000 and 1,757,000 were outstanding for the 2021-2023 and 2022-2024\\nperformance periods, respectively, based on the target award amounts.\\n94\\nThe following table summarizes information about outstanding nonvested performance share units based on the target award levels:\\nPerformance Share Units\\n(In thousands)\\nWeighted-Average\\nGrant Date\\nFair Value\\nNonvested on January\\xa01, 2022\\n4,186\\xa0 $\\n50.90\\xa0\\nGranted\\n1,829\\xa0\\n59.61\\xa0\\nVested\\n(2,088)\\n54.71\\xa0\\nForfeited\\n(221)\\n52.76\\xa0\\nNonvested on December\\xa031, 2022\\n3,706\\xa0 $\\n52.94\\xa0\\nRepresents the target level of performance share units vested as of December 31, 2022 for the 2020-2022 and 2021-2022 performance periods.

We have established asset allocation targets and\\ninvestment guidelines with each investment manager. Our asset allocation targets promote optimal expected return and volatility characteristics given the long-term time\\nhorizon for fulfilling the obligations of the plan. Selection of the targeted asset allocation for U.S. pension plan assets is based upon a review of the expected return and risk\\ncharacteristics of each asset class, as well as the correlation of returns among asset classes. Our target allocation is a mix of 18 percent equity securities, 47 percent fixed-\\nincome securities and 35 percent alternative investments. We believe this target allocation will enable us to achieve the following long-term investment objectives:\\n(1) optimize the long-term return on plan assets at an acceptable level of risk;\\n(2) maintain a broad diversification across asset classes and among investment managers; and\\n(3) maintain careful control of the risk level within each asset class.\\nThe investment guidelines that have been established with each investment manager provide parameters within which the investment managers agree to operate, including\\ncriteria that determine eligible and ineligible securities, diversification requirements and credit quality standards, where applicable. Investment managers agree to obtain written\\napproval for deviations from stated investment style or guidelines. As of December\\xa031, 2022, no investment manager was responsible for more than 24 percent of total U.S.\\npension plan assets.\\nOur target allocation of 18 percent equity securities is composed of 81 percent global equities, 11 percent emerging market equities and 8 percent domestic small-cap and mid-\\ncap equities. Optimal returns through our investments in global equities are achieved through security selection as well as country and sector diversification. As of\\nDecember\\xa031, 2022, investments in our common stock accounted for 9 percent of total global equities and 5 percent of total U.S. pension plan assets. Our investments in global\\nequities are intended to provide diversified exposure to both U.S. and non-U.S. equity markets. Our investments in both emerging market equities and domestic small-cap and\\nmid-cap equities may experience large swings in their market value. Our investments in these asset classes are selected based on capital appreciation potential.\\nOur target allocation of 47 percent fixed-income securities is composed of 62 percent long-duration bonds and 38 percent with multi-strategy alternative credit managers. Long-\\nduration bonds are intended to provide a stable rate of return through investments in high-quality publicly traded debt securities. Our investments in long-duration bonds are\\ndiversified in order to\\n1\\n2\\n1\\n2 \\n98\\nmitigate duration and credit exposure. Multi-strategy alternative credit managers invest in a combination of high-yield bonds, bank loans, structured credit and emerging market\\ndebt. These investments are in lower-rated and non-rated debt securities, which generally produce higher returns compared to long-duration bonds and also help diversify our\\noverall fixed-income portfolio.\\nOur target allocation for alternative investments is 35 percent. These alternative investments include hedge funds, reinsurance, private equity limited partnerships, leveraged\\nbuyout funds, international venture capital partnerships and real estate. The objective of investing in alternative investments is to provide a higher rate of return than that which\\nis typically available from publicly traded equity securities. Alternative investments are inherently illiquid and require a long-term perspective in evaluating investment\\nperformance.\\nInvestment Strategy for Non-U.S. Pension Plans\\nThe long-term target allocation for 66 percent of our international subsidiaries’ pension plan assets, primarily certain of our European and Canadian plans, is 66 percent equity\\nsecurities, 16 percent fixed-income securities and 18 percent other investments. The actual allocation for the remaining 34 percent of the Company’s international subsidiaries’\\npension plan assets consisted of 39 percent mutual, pooled and commingled funds; 23 percent fixed-income securities; 2 percent equity securities; and 36 percent other\\ninvestments as of December\\xa031, 2022. The investment strategies for our international subsidiaries’ pension plans vary greatly, and in some instances are influenced by local law.\\nNone of our pension plans outside the United States is individually significant for separate disclosure.\\nOther Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets\\nPlan assets associated with other postretirement benefits primarily represent funding of one of the U.S. postretirement health care benefit plans through a Voluntary Employee\\nBeneficiary Association (“VEBA”), a tax-qualified trust. The VEBA assets are primarily invested in liquid assets due to the level and timing of expected future benefit\\npayments.\\nThe following table presents total assets by asset class for our other postretirement benefit plans (in millions):\\nDecember 31,\\n2022\\n2021\\nCash and cash equivalents\\n$\\n43\\xa0 $\\n33\\xa0\\nEquity securities:\\nU.S.-based companies\\n133\\xa0\\n184\\xa0\\nInternational-based companies\\n4\\xa0\\n12\\xa0\\nFixed-income securities:\\nGovernment bonds\\n12\\xa0\\n3\\xa0\\nCorporate bonds and debt securities\\n71\\xa0\\n82\\xa0\\nMutual, pooled and commingled funds\\n86\\xa0\\n87\\xa0\\nHedge funds/limited partnerships\\n14\\xa0\\n9\\xa0\\nReal estate\\n6\\xa0\\n5\\xa0\\nOther\\n4\\xa0\\n4\\xa0\\nTotal other postretirement benefit plan assets\\n$\\n373\\xa0 $\\n419\\xa0\\nFair value disclosures related to our other postretirement benefit plan assets are included in Note\\xa016.

For other non-U.S. plans, we base the discount rate assumption on comparable\\nindices within each of the countries. The Company measures the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost or income for pension and other\\npostretirement benefit plans by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plans’ projected benefit cash flows. The rate of compensation increase assumption is\\ndetermined by the Company based upon annual reviews.\\nThe cash balance interest crediting rate for the U.S. qualified pension plan is based on the yield on six-month U.S. Treasury bills on the last day of September of the previous\\nplan year, plus 150 basis points, with a minimum interest crediting rate of 3.80 percent for all active employees and certain former employees. The Company assumes that the\\nultimate interest crediting rate is 140 basis points lower than the plan’s year-end discount rate and that the current interest crediting rate will converge with the ultimate interest\\ncrediting rate after a period of 10 years.\\nThe expected long-term rate of return assumption for U.S. pension plan assets is based upon the target asset allocation and is determined using forward-looking assumptions in\\nthe context of historical returns and volatilities for each asset class, as well as correlations among asset classes. We evaluate the expected long-term rate of return assumption on\\nan annual basis. The expected long-term rate of return assumption used in computing 2022 net periodic benefit income for the U.S. pension plans was 6.75 percent. As of\\nDecember\\xa031, 2022, the 5-year, 10-year and 15-year annualized return for the U.S. pension plan assets was 4.8 percent, 6.8 percent and 5.2 percent, respectively. The\\nannualized return since inception was 10.0 percent.\\nThe weighted-average assumptions for health care cost trend rates were as follows:\\nDecember 31,\\n2022\\n2021\\nHealth care cost trend rate assumed for next year\\n8.25\\xa0%\\n6.75\\xa0%\\nRate to which the trend rate is assumed to decline (the ultimate trend rate)\\n5.50\\xa0%\\n5.25\\xa0%\\nYear that the trend rate reaches the ultimate trend rate\\n2030\\n2027\\nWe review external data and our own historical trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rate assumptions. The Company’s U.S. postretirement health\\ncare benefits are primarily provided through plans with either a capped Company cost or a defined-dollar benefit. This limits the effects of health care inflation on the\\nCompany.\\n101\\nCash Flows\\nThe expected benefit payments for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans for the 10 years succeeding December\\xa031, 2022 are as follows (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2024\\n2025\\n2026\\n2027\\n2028-2032\\nBenefit payments for pension plans\\n$\\n583\\xa0 $\\n531\\xa0 $\\n545\\xa0 $\\n520\\xa0 $\\n495\\xa0 $\\n2,457\\xa0\\nBenefit payments for other postretirement\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0benefit plans\\n53\\xa0\\n51\\xa0\\n48\\xa0\\n46\\xa0\\n43\\xa0\\n190\\xa0\\nTotal\\n$\\n636\\xa0 $\\n582\\xa0 $\\n593\\xa0 $\\n566\\xa0 $\\n538\\xa0 $\\n2,647\\xa0\\nThe Company anticipates making contributions of approximately $42 million to our pension trusts in 2023, all of which will be allocated to our international plans. These\\ncontributions are made in accordance with local laws and tax regulations.\\nDefined Contribution Plans\\nOur Company sponsors qualified defined contribution plans covering substantially all U.S. employees. Under the largest U.S. defined contribution plan, we match participants’\\ncontributions up to a maximum of 3.0 percent to 3.5 percent of compensation, subject to an IRS limit on compensation. The Company’s expense for the U.S. plans totaled $45\\nmillion, $32 million and $43\\xa0million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We also sponsor defined contribution plans in certain locations outside the United States. The\\nCompany’s expense for these plans totaled $79 million in both 2022 and 2021 and $63 million in 2020.\\nMulti-Employer Retirement Plans\\nThe Company participates in various multi-employer retirement plans, which are designed to provide benefits to, or on behalf of, employees of multiple employers. These plans\\nare typically established under collective bargaining agreements. Multi-employer retirement plans are generally governed by a board of trustees composed of representatives of\\nboth management and labor and are generally funded through employer contributions.\\nThe Company’s expense for multi-employer retirement plans totaled $1 million in both 2022 and 2021 and $2 million in 2020. The plans we currently participate in have\\ncontractual arrangements that extend into 2026. If, in the future, we choose to withdraw from any of the multi-employer retirement plans in which we currently participate, we\\nwould record the appropriate withdrawal liability, if any, at that time.\\nNOTE 14: INCOME TAXES\\nIncome before income taxes consisted of the following (in millions):\\nYear Ended December\\xa031,\\n2022\\n2021\\n2020\\nUnited States\\n$\\n3,452\\xa0 $\\n3,538\\xa0 $\\n3,149\\xa0\\nInternational\\n8,234\\xa0\\n8,887\\xa0\\n6,600\\xa0\\nTotal\\n$\\n11,686\\xa0 $\\n12,425\\xa0 $\\n9,749\\xa0\\nIncome taxes consisted of the following (in millions):\\nUnited States\\nState and Local\\nInternational\\nTotal\\n2022\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nCurrent\\n$\\n468\\xa0 $\\n118\\xa0 $\\n1,651\\xa0\\n$\\n2,237\\xa0\\nDeferred\\n(121)\\n(4)\\n3\\xa0\\n(122)\\n2021\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nCurrent\\n$\\n243\\xa0 $\\n106\\xa0 $\\n1,378\\xa0\\n$\\n1,727\\xa0\\nDeferred\\n229\\xa0\\n(10)\\n675\\xa0\\n894\\xa0\\n2020\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nCurrent\\n$\\n296\\xa0 $\\n396\\xa0 $\\n1,307\\xa0\\n$\\n1,999\\xa0\\nDeferred\\n(220)\\n21\\xa0\\n181\\xa0\\n(18)\\nIncludes net tax expense of $195 million related to changes in tax laws in certain foreign jurisdictions.\\n1\\n1 \\n102\\nWe made income tax payments of $2,403 million, $2,168 million and $1,268 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\\nOur effective tax rate reflects the tax benefits of having significant operations outside the United States, which are generally taxed at rates lower than the statutory U.S. federal\\ntax rate. As a result of employment actions and capital investments made by the Company, certain tax jurisdictions provide income tax incentive grants, including Brazil, Costa\\nRica, Singapore and Eswatini. The terms of these grants expire from 2025 to 2036. We anticipate that we will be able to extend or renew the grants in these locations. Tax\\nincentive grants favorably impacted our income tax expense by $406 million, $381 million and $317\\xa0million for the years ended December\\xa031, 2022, 2021 and 2020,\\nrespectively.

For U.S. federal and state tax purposes, the net operating\\nlosses and tax credit carryovers that were acquired in connection with our acquisition of Coca‑Cola Enterprises Inc.’s former North America business and that were generated\\nfrom 1990 through 2010 are subject to adjustments until the year in which they are utilized is no longer subject to examination.

If we were to\\nidentify and implement tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or generate sufficient income of the appropriate character in these jurisdictions in the future,\\nit could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense. The Company believes that it will generate sufficient future taxable income to\\nrealize the tax benefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheet.\\nIn 2022, the Company recognized a net increase of $23 million in its valuation allowances. The increase was primarily due to significant negative evidence on the utilization of\\nexcess foreign tax credits generated in the current year. The increase was also due to net increases in the deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances on certain equity\\ninvestments and the changes in net operating losses in the normal course of business.\\n105\\nIn 2021, the Company recognized a net decrease of $5 million in its valuation allowances. The decrease was primarily due to net decreases in the deferred tax assets and related\\nvaluation allowances on certain equity investments and the changes in net operating losses in the normal course of business.\\nIn 2020, the Company recognized a net increase of $103 million in its valuation allowances. The increase was primarily due to net increases in the deferred tax assets and\\nrelated valuation allowances on certain equity investments.

asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market\\nfor the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, the inputs used to measure fair value are prioritized based\\non a three-level hierarchy. This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The three levels of inputs used\\nto measure fair value are as follows:\\n• Level\\xa01\\xa0— Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\\n• Level\\xa02\\xa0— Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level\\xa01. We value assets and liabilities included in this level using dealer and broker quotations,\\ncertain pricing models, bid prices, quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by\\nobservable market data.\\n• Level\\xa03\\xa0— Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. This includes certain\\npricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.\\n1\\n1 \\n109\\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements\\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP, certain assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. For our Company, the only assets and liabilities that\\nare adjusted to fair value on a recurring basis are investments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values, debt securities classified as trading or available-for-sale,\\nderivative financial instruments and our contingent consideration liability. Additionally, the Company adjusts the carrying value of certain long-term debt as a result of the\\nCompany’s fair value hedging strategy.\\nInvestments in Debt and Equity Securities\\nThe fair values of our investments in debt and equity securities using quoted market prices from daily exchange traded markets are based on the closing price as of the balance\\nsheet date and are classified as Level\\xa01. The fair values of our investments in debt and equity securities classified as Level 2 are priced using quoted market prices for similar\\ninstruments or nonbinding market prices that are corroborated by observable market data. Inputs into these valuation techniques include actual trade data, benchmark yields,\\nbroker/dealer quotes and other similar data. These inputs are obtained from quoted market prices, independent pricing vendors or other sources.\\nDerivative Financial Instruments\\nThe fair values of our futures contracts are primarily determined using quoted contract prices on futures exchange markets. The fair values of these instruments are based on the\\nclosing contract prices as of the balance sheet date and are classified as Level\\xa01.\\nThe fair values of our derivative instruments other than futures are determined using standard valuation models. The significant inputs used in these models are readily\\navailable in public markets, or can be derived from observable market transactions, and therefore have been classified as Level\\xa02. Inputs used in these standard valuation\\nmodels for derivative instruments other than futures include the applicable exchange rates, forward rates, interest rates, discount rates and commodity prices. The standard\\nvaluation model for options also uses implied volatility as an additional input. The discount rates are based on the historical U.S. Deposit or U.S. Treasury rates, and the implied\\nvolatility specific to options is based on quoted rates from financial institutions.\\nIncluded in the fair values of derivative instruments is an adjustment for nonperformance risk. The adjustment is based on current credit default swap (“CDS”) rates applied to\\neach contract, by counterparty. We use our counterparty’s CDS rate when we are in an asset position and our own CDS rate when we are in a liability position. The adjustment\\nfor nonperformance risk did not have a significant impact on the estimated fair values of our derivative instruments.\\nThe following tables summarize those assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in millions):\\nDecember 31, 2022\\nLevel\\xa01\\nLevel\\xa02\\nLevel\\xa03\\nOther\\nNetting\\nAdjustment\\nFair Value\\nMeasurements\\nAssets:\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nEquity securities with readily determinable values\\n$\\n1,801\\xa0 $\\n169\\xa0 $\\n15\\xa0\\n$\\n85\\xa0 $\\n—\\xa0\\n$\\n2,070\\xa0\\nDebt securities\\n—\\xa0\\n975\\xa0\\n8\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n983\\xa0\\nDerivatives\\n2\\xa0\\n239\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n(227)\\n14\\xa0\\nTotal assets\\n$\\n1,803\\xa0 $\\n1,383\\xa0 $\\n23\\xa0\\n$\\n85\\xa0 $\\n(227)\\n$\\n3,067\\xa0\\nLiabilities:\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\nContingent consideration liability\\n$\\n—\\xa0 $\\n—\\xa0 $\\n1,590\\xa0\\n$\\n—\\xa0 $\\n—\\xa0\\n$\\n1,590\\xa0\\nDerivatives\\n4\\xa0\\n1,962\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n—\\xa0\\n(1,678)\\n288\\xa0\\nTotal liabilities\\n$\\n4\\xa0 $\\n1,962\\xa0 $\\n1,590\\xa0\\n$\\n—\\xa0 $\\n(1,678)\\n$\\n1,878\\xa0\\nRefer to Note\\xa04 for additional information related to the composition of our equity securities with readily determinable values and debt securities.\\nRefer to Note\\xa05 for additional information related to the composition of our derivatives portfolio.\\nCertain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy but are included\\nto reconcile to the amounts presented in Note\\xa04.\\nAmounts represent the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow the Company to settle net positive and negative positions and also cash collateral held or placed with\\nthe same counterparties.

Gross transfers between levels within the hierarchy were not\\nsignificant for the years ended December\\xa031, 2022 and 2021.\\nNonrecurring Fair Value Measurements\\nIn addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company records assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as required\\nby U.S. GAAP. Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges or as a result of observable changes in equity securities\\nusing the measurement alternative.\\n7\\n8\\n3\\n4\\n1\\n1\\n2\\n6\\n8\\n5\\n2\\n7\\n8\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n111\\nThe gains and losses on assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are summarized in the following table (in millions):\\nGains (Losses)\\n\\xa0\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2022\\n\\xa0\\n2021 \\xa0\\nAssets held for sale\\n$\\n—\\xa0\\n$\\n(266)\\nOther-than-temporary impairment charges\\n(96)\\n—\\xa0\\nImpairment of intangible assets\\n(57)\\n(78)\\nValuation of shares in equity method investee\\n(24)\\n—\\xa0\\nTotal\\n$\\n(177) \\xa0\\n$\\n(344)\\nThe Company recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $96\\xa0million during the year ended December\\xa031, 2022 related to an equity method investee in Russia. This impairment\\ncharge was derived using Level 3 inputs and was primarily driven by revised projections of future operating results.\\nDuring the year ended December\\xa031, 2022, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $57\\xa0million related to a trademark in Asia Pacific, which was primarily driven by a change in brand\\nstrategy resulting in revised projections of future operating results for the trademark. The fair value of this trademark was derived using discounted cash flow analyses based on Level 3 inputs.\\nDuring the year ended December\\xa031, 2022, we recognized a net loss of $24\\xa0million on assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. The net loss was recorded as a result of an equity\\nmethod investee issuing additional shares of its stock. Accordingly, the Company is required to treat this type of transaction as if the Company had sold a proportionate share of its investment.\\nThis net loss was determined using Level 2 inputs and primarily resulted from the recognition of cumulative translation losses.\\nThe Company is required to record assets and liabilities that are held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell based on the agreed-upon sale price. The Company\\nrecorded charges of $266\\xa0million in the line item other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income related to the restructuring of our manufacturing operations in the United\\nStates. These charges, which were calculated based on Level 3 inputs, primarily impacted the line item property, plant and equipment in our consolidated balance sheet.\\nThe Company recorded an impairment charge of $78\\xa0million related to a trademark in Europe, which was driven by a change in the long-term outlook on the licensing arrangement for a certain\\nbrand. The fair value of this trademark was derived using discounted cash flow analyses based on Level 3 inputs.\\nFair Value Measurements for Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets\\nThe fair value hierarchy discussed above is not only applicable to assets and liabilities that are included in our consolidated balance sheet but is also applied to certain other\\nassets that impact our consolidated financial statements. For example, our Company sponsors a number of pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Assets contributed to\\nthese plans by the Company become the property of the individual plans. Even though the Company no longer has control over these assets, our consolidated financial\\nstatements are impacted by subsequent fair value adjustments to these assets. The actual return on these assets impacts the Company’s future net periodic benefit cost or income\\nas well as amounts recognized in our consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note\\xa013.

The\\nfinancial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States appropriate in the circumstances and, accordingly, include\\ncertain amounts based on our best judgments and estimates. Financial information in this report is consistent with that in the financial statements.\\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of internal controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Our internal control system is supported by a program of internal audits and\\nappropriate reviews by management, written policies and guidelines, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a written Code of Business Conduct adopted by\\nour Company’s Board of Directors, applicable to all officers and employees of our Company and subsidiaries. In addition, our Company’s Board of Directors adopted a written\\nCode of Business Conduct for Non-Employee Directors which reflects the same principles and values as our Code of Business Conduct for officers and employees but focuses\\non matters of relevance to non-employee Directors.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and, even when determined to be effective, can only\\nprovide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject\\nto the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under\\nthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”). Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December\\xa031,\\n2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework)\\n(“COSO”) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial\\nreporting as of December\\xa031, 2022.\\nThe Company’s independent auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, a registered public accounting firm, are appointed by the Audit Committee of our Company’s Board of Directors,\\nsubject to ratification by our Company’s shareowners.

The Audit Committee reviews with the independent auditors the scope and results\\nof the audit effort. The Audit Committee also meets periodically with the independent auditors and the chief internal auditor without management present to ensure that the\\nindependent auditors and the chief internal auditor have free access to the Audit Committee.

In\\xa0our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December\\xa031, 2022\\nand 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December\\xa031, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as\\nof December\\xa0 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013\\nframework) and our report dated February\\xa021, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\\nBasis for Opinion\\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our\\xa0responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a\\npublic accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial\\nstatements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements,\\nwhether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the\\nfinancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\\nfinancial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\nCritical Audit Matters\\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit\\ncommittee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The\\ncommunication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit\\nmatters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\\nAccounting for uncertain tax positions\\nDescription of the\\nMatter\\nAs described in Note 11 and Note 14 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements, the Company is involved in various income tax matters for which the ultimate\\noutcomes are uncertain.

On\\nNovember 18, 2020, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion predominantly siding with the IRS related to the Company’s transfer pricing between its U.S. parent company\\nand certain of its foreign affiliates for tax years 2007 through 2009.\\nWhile the Company continues to disagree with the IRS positions and the portions of the opinion affirming such positions, it is possible that some portion or all of the\\nadjustment proposed by the IRS could ultimately be upheld. As a result of the application of ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes, the Company has recorded a tax\\nreserve of $423 million for this matter as of December 31, 2022.\\nAuditing management’s evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including the uncertain tax position associated with the IRS notice and opinion, was especially challenging\\ndue to the level of subjectivity and significant judgment associated with the recognition and measurement of the tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained.\\n126\\nHow We Addressed the\\nMatter in Our Audit\\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the effectiveness of controls over the Company’s accounting process for uncertain tax positions. Our\\nprocedures included testing controls addressing the completeness of uncertain tax positions, controls relating to the identification and recognition of the uncertain tax\\npositions, controls over the measurement of the unrecognized tax benefit, and controls over the identification of developments related to existing uncertain tax positions.\\nOur audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the assumptions the Company used to assess its uncertain tax positions and related unrecognized tax benefit\\namounts by jurisdiction. We also tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the identification and measurement of uncertain tax positions. We\\nevaluated evidence of management’s assessment of the opinion, including inquiries of tax counsel, inspection of technical memos, and written representations of\\nmanagement. We involved professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in our evaluation of the tax technical merits of the Company’s assessment,\\nincluding the assessment of whether the tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained, the amount of the potential benefits to be realized, and the application of\\nrelevant tax law. We also assessed the Company’s disclosure of uncertain tax positions included in Note 11 and Note 14.\\nValuation of trademarks with indefinite lives and goodwill\\nDescription of the\\nMatter\\nAs described in Note 1 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements, the Company performs an annual impairment test of its indefinite-lived intangible assets,\\nincluding trademarks with indefinite lives and goodwill, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired. Each impairment test may be\\nqualitative or quantitative. Trademarks with indefinite lives and goodwill were $14.2 billion and $18.8 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2022.\\nAuditing the valuation of trademarks with indefinite lives and reporting units with goodwill involved complex judgment due to the significant estimation required in\\ndetermining the fair value of the trademarks with indefinite lives and related reporting units with goodwill, respectively. Specifically, the fair value estimates were\\nsensitive to significant assumptions about future market and economic conditions. Significant assumptions used in the Company’s fair value estimates included sales\\nvolume, pricing, royalty rates, long-term growth rates, and cost of capital, as applicable.\\nHow We Addressed the\\nMatter in Our Audit\\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s annual impairment tests for trademarks with\\nindefinite lives and reporting units with goodwill. For example, we tested management’s risk assessment process to determine whether to perform a quantitative or\\nqualitative test and management’s review controls over the valuation models and underlying assumptions used to develop such estimates. For impairment tests of reporting\\nunits with goodwill, we also tested controls over the determination of the carrying value of the reporting units. We tested the estimated fair values of the trademarks with\\nindefinite lives and reporting units with goodwill based on our risk assessments.\\nOur audit procedures included, among others, comparing significant judgmental inputs to observable third party and industry sources, considering other observable market\\ntransactions, and evaluating the reasonableness of management’s projected financial information by comparing to third party industry projections, third party economic\\ngrowth projections, and other internal and external data. We performed sensitivity analyses of certain significant assumptions to evaluate the change in the fair value of the\\ntrademarks with indefinite lives and reporting units with goodwill and also assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates. In addition, we involved specialists\\nto assist in our evaluation of certain significant assumptions used in the Company’s discounted cash flow analyses. We also assessed the Company’s disclosure of its\\nannual impairment tests included in Note 1.\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1921.\\nAtlanta, Georgia\\nFebruary 21, 2023\\n127\\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\\nTo the Shareowners and the Board of Directors of The Coca-Cola Company\\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nWe have audited The Coca-Cola Company and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December\\xa0 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated\\nFramework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, The Coca-Cola Company and subsidiaries\\n(the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December\\xa031, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.\\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of\\nDecember\\xa0 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareowners’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended\\nDecember\\xa031, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated February 21, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\\nBasis for Opinion\\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting\\nincluded in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial\\nreporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal\\nsecurities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal\\ncontrol over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating\\neffectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable\\nbasis for our opinion.\\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial\\nstatements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that\\n(1)\\xa0pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)\\xa0provide reasonable assurance that\\ntransactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company\\nare being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)\\xa0 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of\\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are\\nsubject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\\nAtlanta, Georgia\\nFebruary 21, 2023\\n128\\nITEM 9.\\xa0\\xa0CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\\nNot applicable.\\nITEM 9A.\\xa0\\xa0CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\\nThe Company, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the\\neffectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in Rule\\xa013a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the\\nperiod covered by this report.

However, the absence of these words or similar expressions does not mean that a \\nstatement is not forward-looking. All statements that address operating performance, events or developments that we expect or \\nanticipate will occur in the future — including statements relating to volume growth, share of sales and net income per share \\ngrowth, and statements expressing general views about future operating results — are forward-looking statements. \\nManagement believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made. However, caution should be \\ntaken not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements because such statements speak only as of the date \\nwhen made. Our Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a \\nresult of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. In addition, forward-looking statements are \\nsubject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our Company’s actual results to differ materially from historical \\nexperience and our present expectations or projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the \\npossibility that the assumptions used to calculate our estimated aggregate incremental tax and interest liability related to the \\npotential unfavorable outcome of the ongoing tax dispute with the United States Internal Revenue Service could significantly \\nchange; those described in Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this report; and those described from time to time \\nin our future reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\\nPart I\\nITEM 1.  BUSINESS\\nIn this report, the terms “The Coca-Cola Company,” “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” mean The Coca-Cola Company and all \\nentities included in our consolidated financial statements.\\nGeneral\\nThe Coca-Cola Company is a total beverage company, and beverage products bearing our trademarks, sold in the United States \\nsince 1886, are now sold in more than 200 countries and territories. We own or license and market numerous beverage brands, \\nwhich we group into the following categories: Trademark Coca-Cola; sparkling flavors; water, sports, coffee and tea; juice, \\nvalue-added dairy and plant-based beverages; and emerging beverages. We own and market several of the world’s largest \\nnonalcoholic sparkling soft drink brands, including Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and Diet Coke/Coca-Cola \\nLight. \\nWe make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of independent \\nbottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and retailers as well as our consolidated bottling and distribution operations. \\nBeverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to the Company account for 2.2 billion of the estimated 64 billion servings \\nof all beverages consumed worldwide every day.\\nWe believe our success depends on our ability to connect with consumers by providing them with a wide variety of beverage \\noptions to meet their desires, needs and lifestyles. Our success further depends on the ability of our people to execute \\neffectively, every day.\\nWe are guided by our purpose, which is to refresh the world and make a difference. Our vision for growth has three connected \\npillars:\\n• Loved Brands. We craft meaningful brands and a choice of drinks that people love and enjoy and that refresh them in \\nbody and spirit.\\n• Done Sustainably. We grow our business in ways that achieve positive change in the world and build a more sustainable \\nfuture for our planet.\\n• For a Better Shared Future. We invest to improve people’s lives, from our employees to all those who touch our business \\nsystem, to our investors, to the communities we call home.\\nThe Coca-Cola Company was incorporated in September 1919 under the laws of the State of Delaware and succeeded to the \\nbusiness of a Georgia corporation with the same name that had been organized in 1892.\\n2\\nOperating Segments\\nThe Company’s operating structure is the basis for our internal financial reporting. Our operating structure includes the \\nfollowing operating segments:\\n• Europe, Middle East and Africa\\n• Latin America\\n• North America\\n• Asia Pacific\\n• Global Ventures\\n• Bottling Investments\\nAdditionally, our operating structure includes operating units, which sit under our four geographic operating segments. The \\noperating units are focused on regional and local execution and are highly interconnected, with the goal of eliminating \\nduplication of resources and scaling new products more quickly. The operating units work closely with five global marketing \\ncategory leadership teams to rapidly scale ideas while staying close to the consumer. The global marketing category leadership \\nteams primarily focus on innovation as well as marketing efficiency and effectiveness. \\nOur operating structure also includes Corporate, which consists of two components: (1) a center focusing on strategic \\ninitiatives, policy, governance and scaling global initiatives, and (2) a platform services organization supporting the operating \\nunits, global marketing category leadership teams and the center by providing efficient and scaled global services and \\ncapabilities, including, but not limited to, transactional work, data management, consumer analytics, digital commerce and \\nsocial/digital hubs. \\nFor additional information about our operating segments and Corporate, refer to Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial \\nStatements set forth in Part II, “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report.\\nExcept to the extent that differences among operating segments are material to an understanding of our business taken as a \\nwhole, the description of our business in this report is presented on a consolidated basis.\\nProducts and Brands\\nAs used in this report:\\n• “concentrates” means flavorings and other ingredients which, when combined with water and, depending on the product, \\nsweeteners (nutritive or non-nutritive) are used to prepare syrups or finished beverages, and includes powders/minerals \\nfor purified water products;\\n• “syrups” means intermediate products in the beverage manufacturing process produced by combining concentrates with \\nwater and, depending on the product, sweeteners (nutritive or non-nutritive);\\n• “fountain syrups” means syrups that are sold to fountain retailers, such as restaurants and convenience stores, which use \\ndispensing equipment to mix the syrups with sparkling or still water at the time of purchase to produce finished \\nbeverages that are served in cups or glasses for immediate consumption;\\n• “Company Trademark Beverages” means beverages bearing our trademarks and certain other beverages bearing \\ntrademarks licensed to us by third parties for which we provide marketing support and from the sale of which we derive \\nan economic benefit; and\\n• “Trademark Coca-Cola Beverages” or “Trademark Coca-Cola” means nonalcoholic beverages bearing the trademark \\nCoca-Cola or any trademark that includes Coca-Cola or Coke (that is, Coca-Cola, Diet Coke/Coca-Cola Light and   \\nCoca-Cola Zero Sugar and all their variations and any line extensions, including caffeine free Diet Coke, Cherry Coke, \\netc.). Likewise, when we use the capitalized word “Trademark” together with the name of one of our other beverage \\nproducts (such as “Trademark Fanta,” “Trademark Sprite” or “Trademark Simply”), we mean nonalcoholic beverages \\nbearing the indicated trademark (that is, Fanta, Sprite or Simply, respectively) and all its variations and line extensions \\n(such that “Trademark Fanta” includes Fanta Orange, Fanta Zero Orange, Fanta Zero Sugar, Fanta Apple, etc.; \\n“Trademark Sprite” includes Sprite, Sprite Zero Sugar, etc.; and “Trademark Simply” includes Simply Orange, Simply \\nApple, Simply Grapefruit, etc.).\\nOur Company operates in two lines of business: concentrate operations and finished product operations.\\nOur concentrate operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as \\n“beverage bases,” syrups, including fountain syrups, and certain finished beverages to authorized bottling operations (to which \\nwe typically refer as our “bottlers” or our “bottling partners”). Our bottling partners either combine concentrates with still or \\n3\\nsparkling water and sweeteners (depending on the product), or combine syrups with still or sparkling water, to produce finished \\nbeverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers, such as cans and refillable and nonrefillable glass and \\nplastic bottles, bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, \\nthrough wholesalers or other bottlers. In addition, outside the United States, our bottling partners are typically authorized to \\nmanufacture fountain syrups, using our concentrates, which they sell to fountain retailers for use in producing beverages for \\nimmediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain \\nretailers. Our concentrate operations are included in our geographic operating segments and our Global Ventures operating \\nsegment.\\nOur finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling soft drinks and a variety of other finished \\nbeverages to retailers, or to distributors and wholesalers who in turn sell the beverages to retailers. Generally, finished product \\noperations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations. These operations \\nconsist primarily of our consolidated bottling and distribution operations, which are included in our Bottling Investments \\noperating segment. In certain markets, the Company also operates non-bottling finished product operations in which we sell \\nfinished beverages to distributors and wholesalers that are generally not one of the Company’s bottling partners. These \\noperations are generally included in one of our geographic operating segments or our Global Ventures operating segment. \\nAdditionally, we sell directly to consumers through retail stores operated by Costa Limited (“Costa”). These sales are included \\nin our Global Ventures operating segment. In the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain \\nretailers, who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers \\nor bottling partners who in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. These fountain syrup sales are \\nincluded in our North America operating segment. \\nFor information regarding net operating revenues and unit case volume related to our concentrate operations and finished \\nproduct operations, refer to the heading “Our Business — General” set forth in Part II, “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and \\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this report.\\nFor information regarding how we measure the volume of Company beverage products sold by the Company and our bottling \\npartners (“Coca-Cola system”), refer to the heading “Operations Review — Beverage Volume” set forth in Part II, “Item 7. \\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this report.\\nWe own and market numerous valuable beverage brands, including the following:\\n• sparkling soft drinks: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke/Coca-Cola Light, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, Fanta, Fresca, Schweppes1, Sprite \\nand Thums Up;\\n• water, sports, coffee and tea: Aquarius, Ayataka, BODYARMOR, Ciel, Costa, Dasani, doğadan, FUZE TEA, Georgia, \\nglacéau smartwater, glacéau vitaminwater, Gold Peak, Ice Dew, I LOHAS, Powerade and Topo Chico; and \\n• juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages: AdeS, Del Valle, fairlife, innocent, Minute Maid, Minute Maid \\nPulpy and Simply. \\n1 Schweppes is owned by the Company in certain countries other than the United States.\\nThe Company has also directly entered the alcohol beverage category in numerous markets outside the United States. In the \\nUnited States, the Company has established a wholly owned, indirect, firewalled subsidiary, which authorizes alcohol-licensed \\nthird parties to use certain of our trademarks and related intellectual property on alcohol beverages that contain Company \\nbeverage bases. The Company’s approach in alcohol focuses on three segments of alcohol ready-to-drink beverages: hard \\nseltzers (e.g., Topo Chico Hard Seltzer), hard alternatives (e.g., Lemon-Dou) and pre-mixed cocktails (e.g., Jack Daniel’s &           \\nCoca-Cola). \\nIn addition to the beverage brands we own, we also provide marketing support and otherwise participate in the sales of other \\nbeverage brands through licenses, joint ventures and strategic relationships. For example, certain Coca-Cola system bottlers \\ndistribute certain brands of Monster Beverage Corporation (“Monster”), primarily Monster Energy, in designated territories in \\nthe United States, Canada and other international territories pursuant to distribution coordination agreements between the \\nCompany and Monster and related distribution agreements between Monster and Coca-Cola system bottlers.\\nConsumer demand determines the optimal menu of Company product offerings. Consumer demand can vary from one market \\nto another and can change over time within a single market. Our Company continually seeks to further optimize its portfolio of \\nbrands, products and services in order to create and satisfy consumer demand in every market.\\nDistribution System\\nWe make our branded beverage products available to consumers in more than 200 countries and territories through our network \\nof independent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and retailers as well as our consolidated bottling and distribution \\noperations. Consumers enjoy finished beverage products bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to the Company at a rate of \\n4\\n2.2 billion servings each day. Our strong and stable bottling and distribution system helps us capture growth by manufacturing, \\ndistributing and selling existing, enhanced and new innovative products to consumers throughout the world.\\nThe Coca-Cola system sold 33.3 billion and 32.7 billion unit cases of our products in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Sparkling \\nsoft drinks represented 69% of our worldwide unit case volume in both 2023 and 2022. Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for \\n47% and 46% of our worldwide unit case volume in 2023 and 2022, respectively. In 2023, unit case volume in the United \\nStates represented 16% of the Company’s worldwide unit case volume. Of the U.S. unit case volume, 61% was attributable to \\nsparkling soft drinks. Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 42% of U.S. unit case volume. Unit case volume outside the United \\nStates represented 84% of the Company’s worldwide unit case volume in 2023. The countries outside the United States in \\nwhich our unit case volumes were the largest were Mexico, China, Brazil and India, which together accounted for 33% of our \\nworldwide unit case volume. Of the non-U.S. unit case volume, 70% was attributable to sparkling soft drinks. Trademark  \\nCoca-Cola accounted for 48% of non-U.S. unit case volume.\\nOur five largest independent bottling partners based on unit case volume in 2023 were as follows:\\n• Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. (“Coca-Cola FEMSA”), which has bottling and distribution operations in Mexico (a \\nsubstantial part of central Mexico, as well as southeast and northeast Mexico), Guatemala, Colombia (most of the \\ncountry), Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Venezuela, Uruguay, Brazil (a major part of the states of São Paulo and Minas \\nGerais; the states of Mato Grosso do Sul, Paraná, Rio Grande do Sul, and Santa Catarina; and part of the states of Goiás \\nand Rio de Janeiro), and Argentina (federal capital of Buenos Aires and surrounding areas); \\n• Coca-Cola Europacific Partners plc (“CCEP”), which has bottling and distribution operations in Andorra, Australia, \\nBelgium, Fiji, continental France, Germany, Great Britain, Iceland, Indonesia, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, \\nNew Zealand, Norway, Papua New Guinea, Portugal, Samoa, Spain and Sweden; \\n• Coca-Cola HBC AG (“Coca-Cola Hellenic”), which has bottling and distribution operations in Armenia, Austria, \\nBelarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Egypt, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, \\nItaly, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Montenegro, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Northern Ireland, Poland, Republic of \\nIreland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Ukraine;\\n• Arca Continental, S.A.B. de C.V., which has bottling and distribution operations in northern and western Mexico, \\nnorthern Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, and the state of Texas and part of the states of New Mexico, Oklahoma and Arkansas \\nin the United States; and\\n• Swire Coca-Cola Limited, which has bottling and distribution operations in 11 provinces and the Shanghai municipality \\nin mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Cambodia, Vietnam and territories in 13 states in the western United States.  \\nIn 2023, these five bottling partners combined represented 42% of our total worldwide unit case volume.\\nBeing a bottler does not create a legal partnership or joint venture between us and our bottlers. Our bottlers are independent \\ncontractors and are not our agents.\\nBottler’s Agreements\\nWe have separate contracts, to which we generally refer as “bottler’s agreements,” with our bottling partners under which our \\nbottling partners are granted certain authorizations by us. Subject to specified terms and conditions and certain variations, the \\nbottler’s agreements generally authorize the bottlers to prepare, package, distribute and sell Company Trademark Beverages in \\nauthorized containers in (but, subject to applicable local law, generally only in) an identified territory. The bottler is obligated to \\npurchase its entire requirement of concentrates or syrups for the designated Company Trademark Beverages from the Company \\nor Company-authorized suppliers. We typically agree to refrain from selling or distributing, or from authorizing third parties to \\nsell or distribute, the designated Company Trademark Beverages throughout the identified territory in the particular authorized \\ncontainers. However, we typically reserve for us or our designee the right (1) to prepare and package such Company Trademark \\nBeverages in such containers in the territory for sale outside the territory; (2) to prepare, package, distribute and sell such \\nCompany Trademark Beverages in the territory in any other manner or form (territorial restrictions on bottlers vary in some \\ncases in accordance with local law); and (3) to handle certain key accounts (accounts that cover multiple territories).\\nWhile under most of our bottler’s agreements we generally have complete flexibility to determine the price and other terms of \\nsale of the concentrates and syrups we sell to our bottlers, as a practical matter, our Company’s ability to exercise its contractual \\nflexibility to determine the price and other terms of sale of concentrates and syrups is subject, both outside and within the \\nUnited States, to competitive market conditions. However, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow \\ntogether through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers’ always changing \\nneeds and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing model in most markets. Under this model, the \\nconcentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in \\nwhich the finished products produced from the concentrates are sold, and package mix. \\n5\\nAs further discussed below, our bottler’s agreements for territories outside the United States differ in some respects from our \\nbottler’s agreements for territories within the United States. \\nBottler’s Agreements Outside the United States\\nBottler’s agreements between us and our authorized bottlers outside the United States generally are of stated duration, subject in \\nsome cases to possible extensions or renewals. Generally, these bottler’s agreements are subject to termination by the Company \\nfollowing the occurrence of certain designated events, including defined events of default and certain changes in ownership or \\ncontrol of the bottlers. Most of the bottler’s agreements in force between us and bottlers outside the United States authorize the \\nbottlers to manufacture and distribute fountain syrups, usually on a nonexclusive basis.\\nIn certain parts of the world outside the United States, we have not granted comprehensive beverage production and distribution \\nrights to the bottlers. In such instances, we have authorized certain bottlers to (1) prepare and package Company Trademark \\nBeverages for sale to other bottlers or (2) purchase Company Trademark Beverages from other bottlers for sale and distribution \\nthroughout their respective designated territories, often on a nonexclusive basis.\\nBottler’s Agreements Within the United States\\nIn the United States, most bottlers operate under a contract to which we generally refer as a “Comprehensive Beverage \\nAgreement” (“CBA”) that is of stated duration, subject in most cases to renewal rights of bottlers and in some cases to renewal \\nrights of the Company. A small number of bottlers continue to operate under legacy bottler’s agreements with no stated \\nexpiration date for Trademark Coca-Cola Beverages and other cola-flavored Company Trademark Beverages. In all instances, \\nthe bottler’s agreements in the United States are subject to termination by the Company for nonperformance or upon the \\noccurrence of certain defined events of default that may vary from contract to contract.\\nCertain U.S. bottlers have been granted certain additional exclusive territory rights for the distribution, promotion, marketing \\nand sale of Company-owned and licensed beverage brands (as defined by the CBAs). We refer to these bottlers as “expanding \\nparticipating bottlers” or “EPBs.” EPBs operate under CBAs (“EPB CBAs”) under which the Company generally retained the \\nrights to produce the applicable beverage products for territories not covered by specific manufacturing agreements, and such \\nbottlers purchase from the Company (or from Company-authorized manufacturing bottlers) substantially all of the finished \\nbeverage products needed in order to service the customers in these territories. Each EPB CBA has a term of 10 years and is \\nrenewable, in most cases by the bottler, and in some cases by the Company, indefinitely for successive additional terms of      \\n10 years each and includes additional requirements that provide for, among other things, a binding national governance model, \\nmandatory incidence pricing and certain core performance requirements. The Company has also entered into manufacturing \\nagreements that authorize certain EPBs that have executed EPB CBAs to manufacture certain beverage products for their own \\naccount and for supply to other bottlers. \\nIn addition, certain U.S. bottlers that were not granted additional exclusive territory rights, which we refer to as “participating \\nbottlers,” converted their legacy bottler’s agreements to CBAs, to which we refer as “participating bottler CBAs,” each of \\nwhich has a term of 10 years, is renewable by the bottler indefinitely for successive additional terms of 10 years each, and is \\nsubstantially similar in most material respects to the EPB CBAs, including with respect to requirements for a binding national \\ngovernance model and mandatory incidence pricing, but includes core performance requirements that vary in certain respects \\nfrom those in the EPB CBAs.\\nThose bottlers that have not signed CBAs continue to operate under legacy bottler’s agreements that include pricing formulas \\nthat generally provide for a baseline price for Trademark Coca-Cola Beverages and other cola-flavored Company Trademark \\nBeverages. This baseline price may be adjusted periodically by the Company, up to a maximum indexed ceiling price, and is \\nadjusted quarterly based upon changes in certain sugar or sweetener prices, as applicable. The U.S. unit case volume prepared, \\npackaged, sold and distributed under these legacy bottler’s agreements is not material.\\nUnder the terms of the bottler’s agreements, bottlers in the United States generally are not authorized to manufacture fountain \\nsyrups. Rather, the Company manufactures and sells fountain syrups to authorized fountain wholesalers (including certain \\nauthorized bottlers) and some fountain retailers. These wholesalers in turn sell the syrups, or deliver them on our behalf, to \\nrestaurants and other retailers.\\nPromotional and Marketing Programs\\nIn addition to conducting our own independent advertising and marketing activities, we may provide promotional and \\nmarketing support and/or funds to our bottlers. In most cases, we do this on a discretionary basis under the terms of \\ncommitment letters or agreements, even though we are not obligated to do so under the terms of the bottler’s agreements \\nbetween our Company and the bottlers. Also, on a discretionary basis in most cases, our Company may develop and introduce \\nnew products, packages and equipment to assist the bottlers. Likewise, in many instances, we provide promotional and \\nmarketing support and/or funds and/or dispensing equipment and repair services to fountain and bottle/can retailers, typically \\npursuant to marketing agreements. \\n6\\nInvestments in Bottling Operations\\nMost of our branded beverage products are prepared, packaged, distributed and sold by independent bottling partners. However, \\nfrom time to time we acquire or take control of a bottling operation, often in underperforming markets where we believe we can \\nuse our resources and expertise to improve performance. Owning a bottling operation enables us to compensate for limited local \\nresources; help focus the bottler’s sales and marketing programs; assist in the development of the bottler’s business and \\ninformation systems; and establish an appropriate capital structure for the bottler. In line with our long-term bottling strategy, \\nwe may periodically consider options for divesting or reducing our ownership interest in a consolidated bottling operation, \\ntypically by selling all or a portion of our interest in the bottling operation to an independent bottler to improve Coca-Cola \\nsystem efficiency. When we sell a consolidated bottling operation to an independent bottling partner in which we have an \\nequity method investment, our Company continues to participate in the bottler’s results of operations through our share of the \\nequity method investee’s earnings or losses.\\nIn addition, from time to time we make equity investments representing noncontrolling interests in certain bottling operations \\nwith the intention of maximizing the strength and efficiency of the Coca-Cola system’s production, marketing, sales and \\ndistribution capabilities around the world by providing expertise and resources to strengthen those businesses. These \\ninvestments are intended to result in increases in unit case volume, net operating revenues and profits at the bottler level, which \\nin turn generate increased sales for our Company’s concentrate operations. When our equity investment provides us with the \\nability to exercise significant influence over the investee bottler’s operating and financial policies, we account for the \\ninvestment under the equity method.\\nSeasonality\\nSales of our ready-to-drink beverages are somewhat seasonal, with the second and third calendar quarters historically \\naccounting for the highest sales volumes. The volume of sales in the beverage business may be affected by weather conditions.\\nCompetition\\nThe commercial beverage industry is highly competitive and consists of numerous companies, ranging from small or emerging \\nto very large and well established. These include companies that, like our Company, compete globally in multiple geographic \\nareas, as well as businesses that are primarily regional or local in operation. Competitive products include numerous \\nnonalcoholic sparkling soft drinks; water products, including flavored and enhanced waters; juices, juice drinks and nectars; \\ndilutables (including syrups and powders); coffees; teas; energy drinks; sports drinks; milk and other dairy-based drinks; plant-\\nbased beverages; functional beverages, including vitamin-based products and relaxation beverages; and various other \\nnonalcoholic beverages. These competitive products are sold to consumers in both ready-to-drink and non-ready-to-drink form. \\nThe Company has directly entered the alcohol beverage category in numerous markets outside the United States. In the United \\nStates, the Company has established a wholly owned, indirect, firewalled subsidiary, which authorizes alcohol-licensed third \\nparties to use certain of our trademarks and related intellectual property on alcohol beverages that contain Company beverage \\nbases. Competitive products include all alcohol ready-to-drink beverages containing various alcohol bases. In many of the \\ncountries in which we do business, PepsiCo, Inc. is a primary competitor. Other significant competitors include, but are not \\nlimited to, Nestlé S.A., Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., Danone S.A., Suntory Beverage & Food Limited, AB InBev, Kirin Holdings, \\nHeineken N.V., Diageo and Red Bull GmbH. We also compete against numerous regional and local companies and, \\nincreasingly, against smaller companies that are developing microbrands and selling them directly to consumers through e-\\ncommerce retailers and other e-commerce platforms. In addition, in some markets, we compete against retailers that have \\ndeveloped their own store or private-label beverage brands.\\nCompetitive factors impacting our business include, but are not limited to, pricing, advertising, sales promotion programs,  \\nin-store displays and point-of-sale marketing, digital marketing, product and ingredient innovation, increased efficiency in \\nproduction techniques, the introduction of new packaging as well as new vending and dispensing equipment, contracting with \\nmarketing assets (theaters, sports arenas, universities, etc.), and brand and trademark development and protection.\\nOur competitive strengths include leading brands with high levels of consumer recognition and loyalty; a worldwide network of \\nbottlers and distributors of Company products; sophisticated marketing capabilities; and a talented group of dedicated \\nemployees. Our competitive challenges include strong competitors in all geographic regions; in many countries, a concentrated \\nretail sector with powerful buyers able to freely choose among Company products, products of competitive beverage suppliers \\nand individual retailers’ own store or private-label beverage brands; new industry entrants; and dramatic shifts in consumer \\nshopping methods and patterns due to a rapidly evolving digital landscape.\\nRaw Materials\\nWe and our bottling partners use various ingredients in our business, including high fructose corn syrup (“HFCS”), sucrose, \\naspartame, acesulfame potassium, sucralose, saccharin, cyclamate, steviol glycosides, ascorbic acid, citric acid, phosphoric \\nacid, caffeine and caramel color; other raw materials such as orange and other fruit juice and juice concentrates, milk, and \\n7\\ncoffee; packaging materials such as polyethylene terephthalate (“PET”), bio-based PET and recycled PET for bottles; and \\naluminum cans, glass bottles and other containers. \\nWater is a main ingredient in substantially all of our products. While historically we have not experienced significant water \\nsupply difficulties, water is a limited natural resource in many parts of the world, and our Company recognizes water \\navailability, quality and sustainability, for both our operations and also the communities where we operate, as one of the key \\nchallenges facing our business.\\nIn addition to water, the principal raw materials used in our business are nutritive and non-nutritive sweeteners. In the United \\nStates, the principal nutritive sweetener is HFCS, which is nutritionally equivalent to sugar. HFCS is available from numerous \\ndomestic sources and has historically been subject to fluctuations in its market price. Adverse weather conditions may affect the \\nsupply of agricultural commodities from which key ingredients for our products are derived. For example, drought conditions in \\ncertain parts of the United States or in other major corn-producing areas of the world may negatively affect the supply of corn, \\nwhich in turn may result in shortages of and higher prices for HFCS. The principal nutritive sweetener used by our business \\noutside the United States is sucrose (i.e., table sugar), which is also available from numerous sources and has historically been \\nsubject to fluctuations in its market price. Our Company generally has not experienced any difficulties in obtaining its \\nrequirements for nutritive sweeteners. In the United States, we purchase HFCS to meet our and our bottlers’ requirements with \\nthe assistance of Coca-Cola Bottlers’ Sales & Services Company LLC (“CCBSS”). CCBSS is a limited liability company that is \\nowned by authorized Coca-Cola bottlers doing business in the United States and Canada. Among other things, CCBSS provides \\nprocurement services to our North American operations and to our U.S. and Canadian bottling partners for the purchase of \\nvarious goods and services, including HFCS.\\nThe principal non-nutritive sweeteners we use in our business are aspartame, acesulfame potassium, sucralose, saccharin, \\ncyclamate and steviol glycosides. Generally, these raw materials are readily available from numerous sources. We purchase \\nsucralose, which we consider a critical raw material, from suppliers in the United States and China. Our Company generally has \\nnot experienced major difficulties in obtaining its requirements for non-nutritive sweeteners. \\nJuice and juice concentrate from various fruits, particularly orange juice and orange juice concentrate, are the principal raw \\nmaterials for our juice and juice drink products. We source our orange juice and orange juice concentrate primarily from Florida \\nand the Southern Hemisphere (particularly Brazil). We work closely with Cutrale Citrus Juices U.S.A., Inc., our primary \\nsupplier of orange juice from Florida and Brazil, to ensure an adequate supply of orange juice and orange juice concentrate that \\nmeets our Company’s standards. However, the citrus industry is impacted by citrus greening disease and the variability of \\nweather conditions that can affect the quality and supply of orange juice and orange juice concentrate. In particular, freezing \\nweather or hurricanes in central Florida may result in shortages and higher prices for orange juice and orange juice concentrate \\nthroughout the industry. In addition, citrus greening disease is reducing the number of citrus trees and increasing grower costs \\nand prices.\\nMilk is the principal raw material for our dairy products. We derive the majority of our dairy revenues through fairlife, LLC \\n(“fairlife”), which purchases milk from dairy cooperatives that in turn source milk from farms within the cooperatives. While \\nour sourcing for milk is currently concentrated among a few dairy cooperatives, we believe we have access to alternate \\nsuppliers, if necessary, to help ensure an adequate supply of milk.\\nWe generate most of our coffee revenues through Costa. Costa purchases Rainforest Alliance Certified and other green coffee \\nthrough multiple suppliers. While most of Costa’s coffee is sourced as readily available bulked commercial grade from Brazil, \\nVietnam and Colombia, many of Costa’s suppliers have vertically integrated supply chains with direct access to yields from \\ncooperatives and producer groups.\\nOur consolidated bottling operations and our non-bottling finished product operations also purchase various other raw \\nmaterials, including, but not limited to, PET resin, preforms and bottles; glass and aluminum bottles; aluminum and steel cans; \\nplastic closures; aseptic fiber packaging; labels; cartons; cases; postmix packaging; and beverage gases, including carbon \\ndioxide and liquid nitrogen. While we generally purchase these raw materials from multiple suppliers and historically have not \\nexperienced significant shortages, certain packaging materials, such as aluminum cans, are available from a limited number of \\nsuppliers. \\nPatents, Copyrights, Trade Secrets and Trademarks\\nOur Company owns numerous patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other know-how and technology, which we collectively \\nrefer to as “technology.” This technology generally relates to beverage products and the processes for their production; \\npackages and packaging materials; design and operation of processes and equipment useful for our business; and certain \\nsoftware. Some of the technology is licensed to suppliers and other parties. Trade secrets are an important aspect of our \\ntechnology, and our sparkling beverage and other beverage formulas are among the important trade secrets of our Company.\\nWe also own numerous trademarks that are very important to our business. Depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are \\nvalid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained. Pursuant to our bottler’s agreements, we \\n8\\nauthorize our bottlers to use applicable Company trademarks in connection with their preparation, packaging, distribution and \\nsale of Company products. In addition, we authorize certain third parties to use applicable Company trademarks in connection \\nwith their preparation, packaging, distribution and sale of beverages bearing Company trademarks in certain territories. We also \\ngrant licenses to third parties from time to time to use certain of our trademarks in conjunction with certain merchandise and \\nfood products. \\nGovernmental Regulation\\nOur Company is required to comply, and it is our policy to comply, with all applicable laws in the countries and territories \\nthroughout the world in which we do business. In many jurisdictions, our operations may come under special scrutiny by \\ncompetition law authorities due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions.\\nIn the United States, the safety, production, storage, transportation, distribution, advertising, marketing, labeling and sale of our \\nCompany’s products and their ingredients are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; the Federal Trade \\nCommission Act; the Lanham Act; state consumer protection laws; various federal and state laws and regulations governing \\ncompetition and trade practices, including the Robinson-Patman Act of 1936, as amended, and the Clayton Antitrust Act of \\n1914, as amended; federal, state and local workplace health and safety laws; various federal and state laws and regulations \\ngoverning our employment practices, including those related to equal employment opportunity and compensation; various \\nfederal, state and local environmental protection laws; privacy and personal data protection laws; and various other federal, \\nstate and local statutes and regulations. We are also required to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Trade \\nSanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act. Outside the United States, our business is subject to numerous similar statutes \\nand regulations, as well as other legal and regulatory requirements and regulatory reviews.\\nVarious jurisdictions have adopted, and may seek to adopt, significant additional product labeling or warning requirements or \\nlimitations on the marketing or sale of our products because of what they contain or allegations that they cause adverse health \\neffects. If these types of requirements become applicable to one or more of our products under current or future environmental \\nor health laws or regulations, they may inhibit sales of such products or make it necessary for us to reformulate certain of our \\nproducts. Under the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (“Proposition 65”) of the state of California, if \\nthe state has determined that a substance causes cancer or harms human reproduction or development, a warning must be \\nprovided for any product sold in the state that exposes consumers to that substance, unless the conditions of an exemption \\n(described below) can be met. The state maintains lists of these substances and periodically adds other substances to these lists. \\nThe detection of even a trace amount of a listed substance can subject an affected product to the requirement of a warning label. \\nHowever, Proposition 65 exempts a product from a warning if the manufacturer can demonstrate that the use of that product \\nexposes consumers to a daily quantity of a listed substance that is:\\n• below a “safe harbor” threshold that may be established;\\n• naturally occurring;\\n• the result of necessary cooking; or\\n• subject to another applicable exemption.\\nOne or more substances that are currently on the Proposition 65 list can be detected in certain Company products at low levels \\nthat are safe. The Company maintains that the presence of each such substance in Company products is subject to an applicable \\nexemption from the warning requirement or that the product is otherwise in compliance with Proposition 65. However, the state \\nof California and other parties have in the past taken a contrary position and may do so in the future. Additionally, the state of \\nCalifornia may include other substances on the Proposition 65 list in the future. \\nBottlers of our beverage products presently offer, among other beverage containers, nonrefillable recyclable containers in the \\nUnited States and various other markets around the world. Some of these bottlers also offer and use refillable containers, which \\nare also recyclable. Legal requirements apply in various jurisdictions in the United States and elsewhere around the world \\nrequiring that deposits or certain ecotaxes or fees be charged in connection with the sale, marketing and use of certain beverage \\ncontainers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary. Other types of statutes and regulations relating to \\nbeverage container deposits, recycling, ecotaxes, product stewardship and/or restrictions or bans on the use of certain types of \\npackaging, including certain packaging containing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”), also apply in various \\njurisdictions in the United States and elsewhere around the world. We anticipate that additional such legal requirements may be \\nproposed or enacted in the future at federal, state and local levels, both in the United States and elsewhere around the world.\\nAll of our Company’s facilities and other operations in the United States and elsewhere around the world are subject to various \\nenvironmental protection statutes and regulations, including those relating to the use and treatment of water resources, \\ndischarge of wastewater and air emissions. In addition, increasing concern over climate change is expected to continue to result \\nin additional legal or regulatory requirements (both inside and outside the United States) designed to reduce or mitigate the \\neffects of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions on the environment, to discourage the use of plastic materials, to \\n9\\nlimit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns, or to expand disclosure of certain \\nsustainability metrics. Our policy is to comply with all such legal requirements. We have made, and plan on continuing to \\nmake, expenditures necessary to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations and to make progress toward \\nachieving our sustainability goals. While compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our Company’s capital \\nexpenditures, net income or competitive position, changes in environmental compliance requirements along with expenditures \\nnecessary to comply with such requirements and to make progress toward achieving our sustainability goals could adversely \\naffect our financial performance. \\nWe are also subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations related to cybersecurity, privacy and data \\nprotection, including the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, China’s Personal Information Protection Law \\nand the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), which became effective on January 1, 2020, as amended by the \\nCalifornia Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which became effective on January 1, 2023. In addition to California, at least 12 other \\nstates in the United States have passed comprehensive privacy laws similar to the CCPA and the CPRA. These laws are either \\nin effect or will go into effect sometime before the end of 2026, and we expect other states to consider adopting similar laws in \\nthe future. Like the CCPA and the CPRA, these laws create, or are expected to create, obligations related to the processing of \\npersonal information, as well as special obligations for the processing of “sensitive” data. Some of the provisions of these laws \\nmay apply to our business activities. The U.S. Congress has also considered legislation relating to data privacy and data \\nprotection, and the U.S. federal government may in the future pass such legislation. The interpretation and application of \\nprivacy, data protection and data residency laws are often uncertain and are expanding in the United States and internationally, \\nincluding in the European Union, Brazil, China and other jurisdictions. We monitor pending and proposed legislation and \\nregulatory initiatives to ascertain their relevance to and potential impact on our business, and we develop strategies to address \\nregulatory trends and developments, including any required changes to our privacy and data protection compliance programs \\nand policies. Globally, we see a trend toward data protection laws and regulations increasing in complexity and number, and we \\nanticipate that our obligations will expand commensurately. As a result, our ability to maximize the utility of our data could be \\nimpacted and we may need to modify our practices to accommodate legal and regulatory constraints and obligations or meet \\nconsumer expectations.\\nFor additional information, refer to Part I, “Item IA. Risk Factors” of this report.\\nHuman Capital Management\\nOur people and culture agendas are critical business priorities. Our Board of Directors, through the Talent and Compensation \\nCommittee, provides oversight of the Company’s policies and strategies relating to talent; leadership and culture, including \\ndiversity, equity and inclusion; and the Company’s compensation philosophy and programs. The Talent and Compensation \\nCommittee also evaluates and approves the Company’s compensation plans, policies and programs applicable to our senior \\nexecutives. In addition, the Corporate Governance and Sustainability Committee of our Board of Directors oversees succession \\nplanning and talent development for our senior executives. \\nEmployees\\nWe believe people are our most important asset, and we strive to attract and retain high-performing talent. As of December 31, \\n2023 and 2022, our Company had approximately 79,100 and 82,500 employees, respectively, of which approximately 9,000 \\nwere located in the United States. The decrease in the total number of employees was primarily due to 2023 refranchising \\nactivity. Our Company, through its divisions and subsidiaries, is a party to numerous collective bargaining agreements. As of \\nDecember 31, 2023, approximately 400 employees in North America were covered by collective bargaining agreements. These \\nagreements typically have terms of three to five years. We currently anticipate that we will be able to successfully renegotiate \\nsuch agreements when they expire. \\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\\nWe believe that a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace that reflects the markets we serve is a strategic business imperative \\nthat is critical to the Company’s continued growth and success. We take a comprehensive view of diversity, equity and \\ninclusion across different races, ethnicities, tribes, religions, socioeconomic backgrounds, generations, abilities, and expressions \\nof gender and sexual identity. \\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had approximately 7,600 employees located in the United States, excluding the employees of the \\nGlobal Ventures operating segment; fairlife; and BA Sports Nutrition, LLC (“BodyArmor”). Of these 7,600 employees, 42% \\nand 49% were female and people of color, respectively. \\nWe seek to create a better shared future for everyone our brands and business touch. We are focused on providing access to \\nequal opportunity and fostering belonging both in our workplaces and the local communities we proudly serve. We have \\npublicly announced our 2030 aspirations to reflect the markets we serve, including, for example, to be 50% led by women \\nglobally. Each of our operating units outside the United States has developed locally relevant diversity, equity and inclusion \\n10\\naspirations. Diversity and inclusion metrics, which highlight progress and help drive accountability, are shared with our senior \\nleaders on a quarterly basis.  \\nWe believe our sustainability goals, including our diversity, equity and inclusion aspirations, are key drivers for growth. \\nAccordingly, our compensation programs for our executives include qualitative and quantitative components to foster the \\ndesign and implementation of sustainable diversity, equity and inclusion strategies and programs that contribute to the \\nrecruitment, development and retention of diverse talent, as well as to encourage progress toward our diversity, equity and \\ninclusion aspirations.\\nWe conduct annual pay equity analyses, with regard to gender globally and race/ethnicity in the United States, to help ensure \\nour base pay structures are fair and to identify and address potential issues or disparities. Also, as permitted by U.S. law, during \\nthe annual rewards cycle, we perform an adverse impact analysis on base pay, annual incentives and long-term incentives to \\nhelp ensure fairness. When appropriate, we make adjustments. \\nWe support many employee-led inclusion networks, which are an integral part of operationalizing and embedding our diversity, \\nequity and inclusion strategies. Our inclusion networks are regionally structured to meet relevant local needs, and they provide \\nemployees with the opportunity to engage with colleagues around the world based on common interests or backgrounds. \\nTalent and Development \\nThrough our comprehensive global talent management processes, we continuously identify and develop our talent for \\nacceleration in our networked organization. We believe in providing challenging and diverse experiences and opportunities to \\nour people to help them develop and grow. \\nOur global career strategy program, called “Thrive,” is designed to provide clarity to employees on what it means to have a \\ncareer at the Company. Through our people-centered approach, we strive to create an integrated, streamlined and inspiring \\ncareer experience. We believe that development is anchored in acquiring skills and work experiences. We focus on investing in \\ninspirational leadership, capability development, and providing learning opportunities to equip our global workforce with the \\nskills they need for the future and to improve employee engagement and retention. We provide a range of formal and informal \\nlearning programs, which are designed to help our employees continuously grow and strengthen their skills throughout their \\ncareers. We provide online learning through a robust catalog of digital content as well as experiential learning opportunities, \\nand we are continually identifying opportunities to provide democratized access to content for all of our employees. We also \\nhave Thrive Opportunity Marketplace, a people-centered technology solution that helps connect project opportunities to \\ninterested employees who have the capacity, skills and interest in short-term experiences and assignments. Additionally, we \\noffer comprehensive Company-wide coaching and mentoring programs that support leadership and employee development at \\nall levels in our organization.\\nWe also believe that talent thrives in a growth-oriented environment where high performance and leadership effectiveness are \\nvalued. Our talent practices rely on data and feedback from multiple sources to help our employees get the transparent and \\ntimely feedback they need to be successful.\\nCompensation and Benefits\\nThrough comprehensive and competitive compensation and benefits, ongoing employee learning and development, and a focus \\non health and well-being, we strive to support our employees in all aspects of their lives. Our compensation programs are \\ndesigned to reinforce our growth agenda and our talent strategy as well as to drive a strong connection between the \\ncontributions of our employees and their pay. \\nWe believe our compensation packages provide the appropriate incentives to attract, retain and motivate our employees. We \\nprovide base pay that is competitive and that aligns with employee positions, skill levels, experience and geographic location. In \\naddition to base pay, we seek to reward employees with annual incentive awards, recognition programs, and equity awards for \\nemployees at certain job levels. \\nWe also offer competitive employee benefits packages, which vary by country and region. These employee benefits packages \\nmay include: 401(k) plan, pension plan, core and supplemental life insurance, financial courses and advisors, employee \\nassistance programs, tuition assistance, commuter assistance, adoption assistance, medical and dental insurance, vision \\ninsurance, health savings accounts, health reimbursement and flexible spending accounts, well-being rewards programs, \\nvacation pay, holiday pay, and parental and adoption leave.\\nCulture and Engagement \\nAs our employees work together to achieve our purpose to refresh the world and make a difference, they collectively build and \\nreinforce our culture. Our culture is rooted in our growth mindset, which expects each employee, leader and function to be \\ncurious, empowered, inclusive and agile. We use a variety of practices to measure and support progress against these growth \\nbehaviors and to ensure that our employees are engaged and fulfilled at work. For example, our Performance Enablement and \\n11\\nCulture & Engagement Survey platforms provide regular opportunities for employees across the organization to provide \\nfeedback on how their leaders, teammates and work experiences support the growth behaviors. Data from questionnaires are \\nanonymized and plotted against historical results to inform teams and functions on areas of strength and opportunities for \\nimprovement. We also encourage regular, live communication across the organization and host quarterly global town halls with \\nour senior leadership that include employee question-and-answer sessions. In addition, function-level town halls are held on a \\nregular basis. \\nAvailable Information\\nThe Company maintains a website at the following address: www.coca-colacompany.com. The information on the Company’s \\nwebsite is not incorporated by reference in this report. We make available on or through our website certain reports and \\namendments to those reports that we file with or furnish to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) in accordance \\nwith the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”).

RISK FACTORS\\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors, which could \\nmaterially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in future periods. The risks described below are not \\nthe only risks facing our Company. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also \\nmay materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods. \\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS\\nUnfavorable general economic and geopolitical conditions could negatively impact our financial results.\\nOur business, operating results, financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected by changes in global economic \\nconditions, including global inflationary pressures, prevailing interest rates, credit market conditions, increased unemployment, \\nlevels of consumer and business confidence, bank failures, commodity (including energy) prices and supply, a recession or \\neconomic slowdown, trade policies, foreign currency exchange rates, changing policy positions or priorities, governmental rules \\nand approaches to taxation, levels of government spending and deficits, and actual or anticipated default on sovereign debt. \\nMany of the jurisdictions in which our products are sold have experienced, and could continue to experience, unfavorable \\nchanges in economic conditions, which could negatively affect the affordability of, and consumer demand for, our beverages, \\nand certain markets in which our products are sold experienced intensified inflation throughout 2023, which may continue to \\naccelerate in 2024. Under difficult economic conditions, consumers may seek to reduce discretionary spending by forgoing \\npurchases of our products or by shifting away from our beverages to lower-priced products offered by other companies, \\nincluding private-label brands, which could reduce our profitability and negatively affect our overall financial performance. In \\naddition, the occurrence or resurgence of global or regional health events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the related \\ngovernmental, private sector and individual consumer responses, could contribute to a recession, depression or global economic \\ndownturn. \\nOther financial uncertainties in our major markets and unstable geopolitical conditions or events in certain markets, including \\ninternational conflicts, civil unrest, acts of war, terrorism, governmental changes, or changes in international relations, could \\nundermine global consumer confidence and reduce consumers’ purchasing power, thereby reducing demand for our products. \\nGeopolitical instability may also lead to heightened security risk, impacting employee safety and/or damage to infrastructure or \\nour assets. At times, we have faced product boycotts resulting from activism, which have reduced demand for our products. \\nRestrictions on our ability to transfer earnings or capital across borders, price controls, limitations on profits, retaliatory tariffs, \\nimport authorization requirements and other restrictions on business activities, which have been or may be imposed or \\nexpanded as a result of political and economic instability, deterioration of economic relations between countries or otherwise, \\ncould impact our profitability. In addition, U.S. trade sanctions against countries designated by the U.S. government as state \\nsponsors of terrorism and/or financial institutions accepting transactions for commerce within such countries could increase \\nsignificantly, which could make it difficult, or even impossible, for us to continue to make sales to bottlers in such countries. \\nThe imposition of retaliatory sanctions against U.S. multinational corporations by countries that are or may become subject to \\nU.S. trade sanctions, or the delisting of our branded products by retailers in various countries in reaction to U.S. trade sanctions \\nor other governmental actions or policies, could also negatively affect our business.\\n12\\nThroughout 2023, the Company faced disruptions to our operations due to international conflicts, including the conflict between \\nRussia and Ukraine and conflicts in the Middle East. These conflicts have resulted, and could continue to result, in volatile \\ncommodity markets; logistical, transportation and supply chain disruptions; increased risk of cyber incidents or other \\ndisruptions to our information systems; reputational risk; heightened risks to employee safety; business disruptions (including \\nlabor shortages); reduced availability and increased costs of transportation, energy, packaging, raw materials and other input \\ncosts; sanctions, export controls and other legislation or regulation; or difficulty protecting and enforcing our intellectual \\nproperty rights. While we currently do not anticipate that the effects of these conflicts will have a material impact on our results \\nof operations, we cannot predict how and the extent to which these conflicts will continue to affect our employees, operations, \\ncustomers or business partners.\\nIncreased competition could hurt our business. \\nWe operate in the highly competitive commercial beverage industry. For additional information regarding the competitive \\nenvironment in which we operate, including the names of certain of our significant competitors, refer to the heading \\n“Competition” set forth in Part I, “Item 1. Business” of this report. Our ability to maintain or gain share of sales in the global \\nmarket or in regional or local markets may be limited as a result of actions by competitors. Competitive pressures may cause the \\nCompany and our bottling partners to reduce prices we charge customers or may restrict our and our bottlers’ ability to increase \\nprices, as may be necessary in response to commodity and other cost increases. Such pressures may also increase marketing \\ncosts along with in-store placement, slotting and other marketing fees. In addition, the rapid growth of e-commerce may create \\nadditional consumer price deflation by, among other things, facilitating comparison shopping, and could potentially threaten the \\nvalue of some of our legacy route-to-market strategies and thus negatively affect revenues. If we do not continuously strengthen \\nour capabilities in marketing and innovation to maintain consumer interest, brand loyalty and market share while strategically \\nexpanding into other profitable categories of the commercial beverage industry, our business could be negatively affected. \\nIf we are not successful in our innovation activities, our financial results may be negatively affected. \\nAchieving our business growth objectives depends in part on our ability to evolve and improve our existing beverage products \\nthrough innovation and to successfully develop, introduce and market new beverage products. The success of our innovation \\nactivities depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance and trends; obtain, maintain and \\nenforce necessary intellectual property rights; and avoid infringing on the intellectual property rights of others. If we are not \\nsuccessful in our innovation activities, we may not be able to achieve our growth objectives, which may have a negative impact \\non our financial results. \\nChanges in the retail landscape or the loss of key retail or foodservice customers could adversely affect our financial results.\\nOur industry is being affected by the trend toward consolidation in, and the blurring of the lines between, retail channels, \\nparticularly in Europe and the United States. Retailers may seek lower prices from us and our bottling partners, may demand \\nincreased marketing or promotional expenditures in support of their businesses, and may be more likely to use their distribution \\nnetworks to introduce and develop private-label brands, any of which could negatively affect the Coca-Cola system’s \\nprofitability. In addition, in developed markets, discounters and value stores are growing at a rapid pace, while in emerging and \\ndeveloping markets, modern trade is growing at a faster pace than traditional trade outlets. Our industry is also being affected \\nby the rapid growth in sales through e-commerce retailers, e-commerce websites, mobile commerce applications and \\nsubscription services, which may result in a shift away from physical retail operations to digital channels. As we and our \\nbottling partners build e-commerce capabilities, we may not be able to develop and maintain successful relationships with \\nexisting and new e-commerce retailers without experiencing a deterioration of our relationships with key customers operating \\nphysical retail channels. If we are unable to successfully adapt to the rapidly changing retail landscape, including the rapid \\ngrowth in digital commerce, our share of sales, volume growth and overall financial results could be negatively affected. In \\naddition, our success depends in part on our ability to maintain good relationships with key retail and foodservice customers. \\nThe loss of one or more of our key retail or foodservice customers could have an adverse effect on our financial performance. \\nIf we are unable to expand our business in emerging and developing markets, our growth could be negatively affected. \\nOur success depends in part on our ability to grow our business in emerging and developing markets, which in turn depends on \\neconomic and political conditions in those markets and on our ability to work with local bottlers to make necessary \\ninfrastructure enhancements to production facilities, distribution networks, sales equipment and technology. Additionally, we \\nrely on local availability of talented management and employees to establish and manage our operations in these markets. \\nScarcity of, or heavy competition for, talented employees could impede our abilities in such markets. Moreover, the supply of \\nour products in emerging and developing markets must match consumer demand for those products. Due to product price, \\nlimited purchasing power and cultural differences, our products may not be accepted in any particular emerging or developing \\nmarket. \\n13\\nIf we do not successfully manage the potential negative consequences of our productivity initiatives, our business operations \\ncould be adversely affected.\\nWe believe that improved productivity is essential to achieving our long-term growth objectives and, therefore, a leading \\npriority of our Company is to design and implement the most effective and efficient business model possible. Consequently, we \\ncontinuously search for productivity opportunities in our business. Some of the actions we may take from time to time in \\npursuing these opportunities may become a distraction for our managers and employees and may disrupt our ongoing business \\noperations; cause deterioration in employee morale, which may make it more difficult for us to retain or attract qualified \\nmanagers and employees; disrupt or weaken the internal control structures of the affected business operations; and give rise to \\nnegative publicity, which could affect our corporate reputation. If we are unable to successfully manage the potential negative \\nconsequences of our productivity initiatives, our business operations could be adversely affected.\\nIf we are unable to attract or retain a highly skilled and diverse workforce, our business could be negatively affected.\\nThe success of our business depends on our Company’s and the Coca-Cola system’s ability to attract, hire, develop, motivate \\nand retain a highly skilled and diverse workforce as well as on our success in nurturing a culture that supports our growth and \\naligns employees around the Company’s purpose and work that matters most. Competition for, along with compensation and \\nbenefits expectations of, existing and prospective employees has increased, especially in light of changing worker expectations \\nand talent marketplace variability regarding flexible work models. In addition, the broader labor market is experiencing a \\nshortage of qualified workers, which has further increased the competition we face for qualified employees. We may not be able \\nto successfully compete for, attract or retain the highly skilled and diverse workforce that we want and may require for our \\nfuture business needs, such as employees with advanced technology, artificial intelligence and machine learning, social media \\nand digital marketing skills, and/or digital and analytics capabilities. Changes in immigration laws and policies could also make \\nit more difficult for us to recruit or relocate highly skilled technical, professional and management personnel to meet our \\nbusiness needs. In addition, the unexpected loss of experienced and highly skilled employees due to an increase in aggressive \\nrecruiting for best-in-class talent could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitiveness. Failure to \\nattract, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled and diverse talent; to meet our goals related to fostering an inclusive \\nand diverse culture; to develop and implement an adequate succession plan for our management team; to maintain a corporate \\nculture that fosters innovation, collaboration and inclusion; or to design and successfully implement flexible work models that \\nmeet the expectations of employees and prospective employees could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business \\nand our future success. \\nDisruption of our supply chain, including increased commodity, raw material, packaging, energy, transportation and other \\ninput costs, may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\\nAt times, we have experienced, and could continue to experience, disruptions in our manufacturing operations and supply \\nchain. In connection with our manufacturing and bottling operations, we and our bottling partners are dependent upon, among \\nother things, various ingredients and other raw materials and packaging materials. For additional information on the raw \\nmaterials and supplies we use in our business, refer to the heading “Raw Materials” set forth in Part I, “Item 1. Business” of this \\nreport. Some of the raw materials and supplies used in the production of our products are available from a limited number of \\nsuppliers or from a sole supplier or are in short supply when seasonal demand is at its peak. We and our bottling partners may \\nnot be able to maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with these suppliers, and our contingency plans may not be \\neffective in preventing disruptions that may arise from shortages of any ingredients or other raw materials. Furthermore, some \\nof our suppliers are located in countries experiencing political instability or other risks and/or unfavorable economic conditions. \\nIn addition, adverse and extreme weather conditions may affect the supply of agricultural commodities from which key \\ningredients for our products are derived. Any sustained or significant disruption to the manufacturing or sourcing of products or \\nmaterials could increase our costs and interrupt product supply, which could adversely impact our business.\\nWe and our independent bottlers operate a large fleet of trucks and other motor vehicles to distribute beverage products to \\ncustomers. In addition, we and our independent bottlers use a significant amount of electricity, natural gas and other energy \\nsources to operate production plants, bottling plants and distribution facilities. Increases in energy demand have in the past \\nresulted, and could in the future result, in higher energy prices, impacting us and our independent bottlers.\\nThe raw materials and other supplies, including ingredients, agricultural commodities, energy, fuel, packaging materials, \\ntransportation, labor and other supply chain inputs that we use for the production and distribution of our products, are subject to \\nprice volatility and fluctuations in availability caused by many factors. These factors include changes in supply and demand; \\nsupplier capacity constraints; a deterioration of our or our bottling partners’ relationships with suppliers; international conflicts; \\npolitical uncertainties; acts of terrorism; governmental instability; inflation; weather conditions (including the effects of climate \\nchange); wildfires, floods and other natural disasters; disease or pests (including the impact of citrus greening disease on the \\ncitrus industry); agricultural uncertainty; health epidemics, pandemics or other contagious outbreaks (including COVID-19); \\nlabor shortages, strikes or work stoppages; changes in or the enactment of new laws and regulations; governmental actions or \\ncontrols (including import/export restrictions, such as new or increased tariffs, sanctions, quotas or trade barriers); port \\n14\\ncongestion or delays; transport capacity constraints; cybersecurity incidents or other disruptions; or fluctuations in foreign \\ncurrency exchange rates. Many of our raw materials and supplies are purchased in the open market and the prices we pay for \\nsuch items are subject to fluctuation. We expect the inflationary pressures on certain input and other costs to continue to impact \\nour business in 2024. \\nOur attempts to offset cost pressures, such as through price increases of some of our products, may not be successful. Higher \\nproduct prices may result in reductions in sales volume. Consumers may be less willing to pay a price differential for our \\nbranded products and may increasingly purchase lower-priced offerings, or may forgo some purchases altogether. To the extent \\nthat price increases are not sufficient to offset higher costs adequately or in a timely manner, and/or if they result in significant \\ndecreases in sales volume, our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. Furthermore, we may not \\nbe able to offset cost increases through productivity initiatives or through our commodity hedging activity.\\nIf we do not successfully integrate and manage our acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations, or if we are unable to \\nrealize a significant portion of the anticipated benefits of our joint ventures or strategic relationships, our financial results \\ncould suffer. \\nWe routinely evaluate opportunities to acquire businesses or brands to expand our beverage portfolio and capabilities. \\nAdditionally, from time to time, we have acquired or taken control of bottling operations, often in underperforming markets \\nwhere we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance. Acquisitions of businesses, brands or \\nbottling operations may involve significant challenges and risks, and the expected benefits, including cost and growth synergies \\nassociated with such acquisitions, may take longer to realize than expected or may not be realized at all. \\nWe have encountered, and may in the future encounter, challenges in successfully integrating the operations, technologies, \\nservices, products and systems of any acquired businesses, brands or bottling partners in an effective, timely and cost-efficient \\nmanner. We have faced, and may in the future face, difficulties in operating through new business models and/or supply chain \\nmodels, or in new categories or territories, and challenges in extending Company controls (including internal controls over \\nfinancial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, data protection and cybersecurity), policies and governance structures \\n(including with respect to food safety and quality, occupational safety, and sustainability) to newly acquired businesses, brands \\nor bottling operations, which, at times, has resulted in increased costs and negative publicity. Our financial performance is \\nimpacted by how well we can integrate and manage our acquisitions, and we may not be able to achieve our strategic and \\nfinancial objectives for acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations. If we incur unforeseen liabilities or costs in \\nconnection with acquiring or integrating businesses, brands or bottling operations, experience internal control or product quality \\nfailures, or are unable to achieve our strategic and financial objectives for acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations, \\nour consolidated results could be negatively affected. \\nWe also participate in the sales of other beverage brands through licenses, joint ventures and strategic relationships. If we are \\nunable to successfully manage our relationships with our joint venture partners or our strategic relationships, including our \\nrelationship with Monster, or if for any other reason we fail to realize all or a significant portion of the benefits we expect from \\nour joint ventures or strategic relationships, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\\nIf our third-party service providers and business partners do not satisfactorily fulfill their commitments and responsibilities, \\nor experience adverse events, our financial results could suffer. \\nIn the conduct of our business, we rely on relationships with third parties, including cloud data storage and other information \\ntechnology service providers, suppliers, distributors, contractors, joint venture partners and other external business partners, for \\ncertain services in support of key portions of our operations. These third parties are subject to similar risks as we are relating to \\ncybersecurity, privacy violations, business interruption, and systems and employee failures, and are subject to legal, regulatory \\nand market risks of their own. Our third-party service providers and business partners may not fulfill their respective \\ncommitments and responsibilities in a timely manner and in accordance with the agreed-upon terms or applicable laws. In \\naddition, while we have procedures in place for assessing risk along with selecting, managing and monitoring our relationships \\nwith third-party service providers and other business partners, we do not have control over their business operations or \\ngovernance and compliance systems, practices and procedures, which increases our financial, legal, cybersecurity, reputational \\nand operational risk. If we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships, or for any reason our third-party \\nservice providers or business partners fail to satisfactorily fulfill their commitments and responsibilities or experience events \\nthat could directly or indirectly impact us, our financial results could suffer.\\nIf we are unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, or if we or our bottling partners \\nexperience strikes, work stoppages or labor unrest, our business could suffer. \\nMany of our employees at our key manufacturing locations and bottling plants are covered by collective bargaining agreements. \\nWhile we generally have been able to renegotiate collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire and \\nregard our relations with employees and their representatives as generally satisfactory, negotiations may nevertheless be \\nchallenging, as the Company must have competitive cost structures in each market while meeting the compensation and \\n15\\nbenefits needs of our employees. If we are unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, our labor \\ncosts could increase, which could affect our profit margins. In addition, many of our bottling partners’ employees are \\nrepresented by labor unions. Strikes, work stoppages or other forms of labor unrest at any of our major manufacturing facilities \\nor at our bottling operations or our major bottlers’ plants could impair our ability to supply concentrates and syrups to our \\nbottling partners or our bottlers’ ability to supply finished beverages to customers, which could reduce our net operating \\nrevenues and could expose us to customer claims. Furthermore, from time to time, we and our bottling partners restructure \\nmanufacturing and other operations to improve productivity, which may have negative impacts on employee morale and work \\nperformance, result in escalation of grievances and adversely affect the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements. If these \\nlabor relations are not effectively managed at the local level, they could escalate in the form of corporate campaigns supported \\nby the labor organizations and could negatively affect our Company’s overall reputation and brand image, which in turn could \\nhave a negative impact on our products’ acceptance by consumers.\\nRISKS RELATED TO CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS \\nObesity and other health-related concerns may reduce demand for some of our products. \\nThere is concern among consumers, public health professionals and government agencies about the health problems associated \\nwith obesity. Ongoing public concern about obesity; other health-related public concerns surrounding consumption of \\nsweetened beverages; the effects or perceived effects of the usage of weight-loss drugs on consumption patterns; potential new \\nor increased taxes on sweetened beverages by government entities to reduce consumption or to raise revenue; additional \\ngovernmental regulations concerning the advertising, marketing, labeling, packaging or sale of our sweetened beverages; and \\nnegative publicity resulting from actual or threatened legal actions against us or other companies in our industry relating to the \\nmarketing, labeling or sale of sweetened beverages may reduce demand for, or increase the cost of, our sweetened beverages, \\nwhich could adversely affect our profitability.\\nIf we do not address evolving consumer product and shopping preferences, our business could suffer. \\nConsumer product preferences have evolved and continue to evolve as a result of, among other things, health, wellness and \\nnutrition considerations, including concerns regarding caloric intake associated with sweetened beverages and the perceived \\nundesirability of artificial ingredients; concerns regarding the perceived health effects of, or location of origin of, ingredients, \\nraw materials or substances in our products or packaging, including due to the results of third-party studies (whether or not \\nscientifically valid); shifting consumer demographics; changes in consumer tastes and needs coupled with a rapid expansion of \\nbeverage options and delivery methods; changes in consumer lifestyles; concerns regarding the environmental, social and \\nsustainability impact of ingredient sources and the product manufacturing process; consumer emphasis on transparency related \\nto ingredients we use in our products and collection and recyclability of, and amount of recycled content contained in, our \\npackaging containers and other materials; concerns about the health and welfare of animals in our dairy supply chain; and \\ncompetitive product and pricing pressures. In addition, in many of our markets, shopping patterns are being affected by the \\ndigital evolution, with consumers rapidly embracing shopping by way of mobile device applications, e-commerce retailers and \\ne-commerce websites or platforms. If we fail to address changes in consumer product and shopping preferences, do not \\nsuccessfully anticipate and prepare for future changes in such preferences, or are ineffective or slow in developing and \\nimplementing appropriate digital transformation initiatives, our share of sales, revenue growth and overall financial results \\ncould be negatively affected.\\nProduct safety and quality concerns could negatively affect our business. \\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to maintain consumer confidence in the safety and quality of all of our \\nproducts. We have rigorous product safety and quality standards, which we expect our operations as well as our bottling \\npartners to meet. However, despite our strong commitment to product safety and quality, we or our bottling partners at times \\nhave not met, and may not always meet, these standards, particularly as we expand our product offerings through innovation or \\nacquisitions into beverage categories, such as value-added dairy and plant-based beverages, that are beyond our traditional \\nrange of beverage products. We and our bottling partners have had, and may in the future need, to recall products if they \\nbecome contaminated or adulterated by any means or if they are mislabeled. A widespread product recall could result in \\nsignificant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, and lost sales due to the unavailability of \\nproduct for a period of time, and could also subject us to product liability claims and negative publicity, all of which could \\ncause our business to suffer.\\nPublic debate and concern about perceived negative health consequences of certain ingredients, such as non-nutritive \\nsweeteners and biotechnology-derived substances, and of other substances present in our beverage products or packaging \\nmaterials, may reduce demand for our beverage products or result in additional governmental regulation. \\nPublic debate and concern about perceived negative health consequences of certain ingredients in our beverage products, such \\nas synthetic colors, non-nutritive sweeteners and biotechnology-derived substances; substances that are present in our beverage \\nproducts naturally or that occur as a result of the manufacturing process, such as 4-methylimidazole (“4-MEI”), a chemical \\n16\\ncompound that is formed during the manufacturing of certain types of caramel coloring used in cola-flavored beverages; or \\nsubstances used in packaging materials, such as bisphenol A (“BPA”), an odorless, tasteless food-grade chemical commonly \\nused in the food and beverage industries as a component in the coating of the interior of cans, may affect consumers’ \\npreferences and cause them to shift away from some of our beverage products. In addition, increasing public concern about \\nperceived or potential health consequences of the presence of ingredients or substances in our beverage products or in \\npackaging materials (or alleged presence of substances such as PFAS) and/or the results of third-party studies (whether or not \\nscientifically valid) purporting to assess the health implications of consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in \\ncertain of our products or packaging materials have resulted, and could result, in additional governmental regulations \\nconcerning the advertising, marketing, labeling, packaging or sale of our beverages; limitations on the use of certain ingredients \\nor packaging; potential new or increased taxes on our beverages by government entities; and negative publicity, or actual or \\nthreatened legal actions against us or other companies in our industry, all of which could damage the reputation of, and may \\nreduce demand for, our beverage products. \\nIf we are not successful in our efforts to digitalize the Coca-Cola system, our financial results could be negatively affected. \\nThe digital evolution is affecting how we interact with consumers, customers, suppliers, bottlers and other business partners and \\nstakeholders. We believe our future success will depend in part on our ability to adapt to and thrive in the digital environment. \\nTherefore, one of our top priorities is to digitalize the Coca-Cola system by, among other things, creating more relevant and \\nmore personalized experiences wherever our system interacts with consumers, whether in a digital environment or through \\ndigital devices in an otherwise physical environment; finding ways to create more powerful digital tools and capabilities for the \\nCoca-Cola system’s retail customers to enable them to grow their businesses; and digitalizing operations through the use of \\ndata, artificial intelligence, automation, robotics and digital devices to increase efficiency and productivity. If we are not \\nsuccessful in our efforts to digitalize the Coca-Cola system, our ability to increase sales and improve margins may be negatively \\naffected, and the cost and expenses we have incurred or may incur in connection with our digitalization initiatives may \\nadversely impact our financial performance. \\nIf negative publicity, whether or not warranted, concerning product safety or quality, workplace and human rights, obesity \\nor other issues damages our brand image, corporate reputation and social license to operate, our business may suffer.\\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to maintain the brand image of our existing products, build the brand image for \\nnew products and brand extensions, and maintain our corporate reputation and social license to operate. However, our \\ncontinuing investment in advertising and marketing and our strong commitment to product safety and quality and human rights \\nhave not always had, and may not in the future always have, the desired impact on our products’ brand image and on consumer \\npreferences. Product safety or quality issues, actual or perceived, or allegations of product contamination, even when false or \\nunfounded, could tarnish the image of the affected brands and may cause consumers to choose other products. In some \\nemerging markets, the production and sale of counterfeit or “spurious” products, which we and our bottling partners may not be \\nable to fully combat, may damage the image and reputation of our products. In addition, from time to time, we and our \\nexecutives have engaged, and may in the future engage, in public policy endeavors that are either directly related to our \\nproducts and packaging or to our business operations and the general economic climate affecting the Company. These \\nengagements in public policy debates have been, and could in the future be, the subject of criticism from advocacy groups or \\nothers that have a differing point of view and could result in adverse media and consumer reaction, including product boycotts. \\nSimilarly, our sponsorship relationships and associations with influencers have subjected us in the past, and could subject us in \\nthe future, to negative publicity as a result of actual or alleged misconduct by individuals, hosts or entities associated with \\norganizations we sponsor or support financially or through in-kind contributions, as well as by the influencers we collaborate \\nwith who may engage in actions or express opinions that may negatively reflect on our brand. Likewise, campaigns by activists \\nconnecting us, or our bottling system or supply chain, with workplace, human rights or animal welfare issues, whether actual or \\nperceived, could adversely impact our corporate image and reputation. Additionally, negative postings or comments on social \\nmedia or networking websites about the Company or one of its brands, even if inaccurate or malicious, have in the past, and \\ncould in the future, generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the Company. Furthermore, \\nallegations, even if untrue, that we are not respecting internationally recognized human rights; actual or perceived failure by our \\nsuppliers or other business partners to comply with applicable workplace and labor laws, including child labor laws, or their \\nactual or perceived abuse or misuse of migrant workers; actual or perceived failure by our suppliers, joint venture partners or \\nother business partners to engage in proper animal welfare practices; and adverse publicity surrounding obesity and health \\nconcerns related to our products, water usage, environmental impact, labor relations or the like could negatively affect our \\nCompany’s overall reputation and brand image, which in turn could have a negative impact on our products’ acceptance by \\nconsumers. In addition, if we fail to respect our employees’ and our supply chain workers’ human rights, or inadvertently \\ndiscriminate against any group of employees or hiring prospects, our ability to hire and retain the best talent will be diminished, \\nwhich could have an adverse impact on our overall business. \\n17\\nIf we are unable to successfully manage new product launches, our business and financial results could be adversely \\naffected. \\nDue to the highly competitive nature of the commercial beverage industry, the Company continually introduces new products \\nand evolves existing products to stimulate consumer demand. For instance, the Company has directly entered the alcohol \\nbeverage category in numerous markets outside the United States, and in the United States, the Company has established a \\nwholly owned, indirect, firewalled subsidiary, which authorizes alcohol-licensed third parties to use certain of our trademarks \\nand related intellectual property on alcohol beverages that contain Company beverage bases. The success of new and evolved \\nproducts depends on several factors, including timely and successful product development, adherence to new global and/or \\nlocal standards of practice, consumer acceptance and stakeholder perception. Such endeavors may also involve significant risks \\nand uncertainties, including greater execution risks; higher costs; lower rates of sales; distraction of management from existing \\noperations; lower product, category or industry knowledge and expertise; slower than expected or inadequate return on \\ninvestments; increased competitive pressures; stakeholder scrutiny; and reliance on the performance of third parties. As we \\nbecome subject to additional governmental regulations, including alcohol regulations related to licensing, trade and pricing \\npractices, labeling, advertising, promotion and marketing practices, and relationships with distributors, we may become \\nexposed to the risk of increased compliance costs and disruptions to our existing business.\\nRISKS RELATED TO THE COCA-COLA SYSTEM \\nWe rely on our bottling partners for a significant portion of our business. If we are unable to maintain good relationships \\nwith our bottling partners, our business could suffer. \\nWe generate a significant portion of our net operating revenues by selling concentrates and syrups to independent bottling \\npartners. As independent companies, our bottling partners, some of which are publicly traded companies, make their own \\nbusiness decisions that may not always align with our interests. In addition, some of our bottling partners have the right to \\nmanufacture or distribute their own products or certain products of other beverage companies. If we are unable to maintain \\noperating and strategic alignment or agree on appropriate pricing and marketing and advertising support, or if our bottling \\npartners are not satisfied with our brand innovation and development efforts, they may take actions that, while maximizing  \\ntheir own short-term profits, may be detrimental to our Company or our brands, or they may devote more of their resources   \\nto business opportunities or products other than those of the Company. Such actions could, in the long term, have an adverse \\neffect on our profitability. \\nIf our bottling partners’ financial condition deteriorates, our business and financial results could be affected. \\nIn the vast majority of our markets, our products are sold and distributed by independent bottling partners, and we therefore \\nderive a significant portion of our net operating revenues from sales of concentrates and syrups to independent bottling partners. \\nAccordingly, the success of our business depends in part on our bottling partners’ financial strength and profitability. While \\nunder our agreements with our bottling partners we generally have the right to unilaterally change the prices we charge for our \\nconcentrates and syrups, our ability to do so may be materially limited by our bottling partners’ financial condition and their \\nability to pass price increases along to their customers. In addition, we have investments in certain of our bottling partners, \\nwhich we account for under the equity method, and our operating results include our proportionate share of such bottling \\npartners’ income or loss. Our bottling partners’ financial condition is affected in large part by conditions and events that are \\nbeyond our and their control, including competitive and general market conditions; the availability of capital and other \\nfinancing resources on reasonable terms; loss of major customers; changes in or additional regulations; or disruptions of \\nbottling operations that may be caused by strikes, work stoppages, labor unrest, natural disasters, international conflicts, acts of \\nwar, health epidemics, pandemics or other catastrophic events. A deterioration of the financial condition or results of operations \\nof one or more of our major bottling partners could adversely affect our net operating revenues from sales of concentrates and \\nsyrups; and, if such deterioration involves one or more of our equity method investee bottling partners, it could also result in a \\ndecrease in our equity income and/or impairments of our equity method investments.\\nWe may from time to time engage in refranchising activities or divestitures of certain brands or businesses, which could \\nadversely affect our business and results of operations.\\nAs part of our strategic initiative to focus on our core business of building brands and leading our system of bottling partners, \\nwe continue to seek opportunities to refranchise our consolidated bottling operations. Our refranchising activities require \\nsignificant attention and effort on the part of, and therefore may be a distraction for, senior management. If we are unable to \\ncomplete future refranchising transactions on terms and conditions favorable to us, or if our refranchising partners are not \\nefficient or not aligned with our long-term vision for the Coca-Cola system, our business and results of operations could be \\nadversely affected. Additionally, we have divested and may in the future divest certain brands or businesses. These divestitures \\nmay adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition if we are unable to offset impacts \\nfrom the loss of revenue associated with the divested brands or businesses, or if we are otherwise unable to achieve the \\nanticipated benefits or cost savings from such divestitures. \\n18\\nRISKS RELATED TO REGULATORY AND LEGAL MATTERS \\nIncreases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or regulations, or unfavorable resolutions of tax matters could \\nhave a material adverse impact on our financial results. \\nWe are subject to income tax in the United States and numerous other jurisdictions in which we generate profits. Our overall \\neffective income tax rate is a function of applicable local tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate, tax treaties between \\nsuch jurisdictions, and the geographic mix of our income before income taxes, which is itself impacted by currency movements. \\nConsequently, the isolated or combined effects of unfavorable movements in tax rates, geographic mix or foreign currency \\nexchange rates could reduce our net income. Tax laws and regulations, including rates of taxation, are subject to revisions by \\nindividual taxing jurisdictions, and such revisions may result from multilateral agreements. \\nMany jurisdictions have enacted legislation and adopted policies resulting from the Organization for Economic Co-operation \\nand Development’s (“OECD”) Anti-Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project. The OECD is currently coordinating a two \\npillared project on behalf of the G20 and other participating countries which would grant additional taxing rights over profits \\nearned by multinational enterprises to the countries in which their products are sold and services rendered. Pillar One would \\nallow countries to reallocate a portion of profits earned by multinational businesses with an annual global revenue exceeding \\n€20 billion and a profit margin of over 10% to applicable market jurisdictions. While the OECD issued draft language for the \\ninternational implementation of Pillar One in October 2023, both the substantive rules and implementation process remain \\nunder discussion at the OECD so the timetable for any implementation remains uncertain. \\nIn December 2021, the OECD issued Pillar Two model rules which would establish a global per-country minimum tax of 15%, \\nand the European Union has approved a directive requiring member states to incorporate similar provisions into their respective \\ndomestic laws. The directive requires the rules to initially become effective for fiscal years starting on or after December 31, \\n2023. While it is uncertain whether the United States will enact legislation to adopt Pillar Two, numerous countries have \\nenacted legislation, or have indicated their intent to adopt legislation, to implement certain aspects of Pillar Two effective \\nJanuary 1, 2024, with general implementation of the remaining global minimum tax rules by January 1, 2025. The OECD and \\nimplementing countries are expected to continue to make further revisions to their legislation and release additional guidance. \\nThe Company will continue to monitor developments to determine any potential impact in the countries in which we operate. \\nTo the extent additional legislative changes take place in the countries in which we operate, it is possible that these changes \\nmay increase uncertainty and have a material impact on our net income and cash flow. Significant judgment is required in \\ndetermining our annual income tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions. Although we believe our tax estimates are \\nreasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical \\nincome tax provisions, estimates and accruals. The results of audits or related disputes could have a material adverse effect on \\nour financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made and for periods for \\nwhich the statute of limitations is open.\\nFor instance, the United States Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) is seeking to increase our U.S. taxable income for tax years \\n2007 through 2009 by an amount that creates a potential additional U.S. federal income tax liability of approximately \\n$3.3 billion for that period, plus interest. The Company firmly believes that the IRS’ claims are without merit and is pursuing, \\nand will continue to pursue, all available administrative and judicial remedies necessary to vigorously defend its position. On \\nNovember 18, 2020, the U.S. Tax Court (“Tax Court”) issued an opinion (“Opinion”) predominantly siding with the IRS. On \\nNovember 8, 2023, the Tax Court issued a supplemental opinion (together with the original Tax Court opinion, “Opinions”) \\nalso siding with the IRS as to the validity of the blocked-income regulations and its application to the Brazilian legal \\nrestrictions. Although the Company disagrees with the unfavorable portions of the Opinions and intends to vigorously defend \\nits position, considering all avenues of appeal, there is no assurance that the courts will ultimately rule in the Company’s favor. \\nIt is therefore possible that all or some of the unfavorable portions of the Opinions could ultimately be upheld. In that event, the \\nCompany would be subject to significant additional liabilities for the years at issue and potentially also for the subsequent years \\nif the unfavorable portions of the Opinions were to be applied to the foreign licensees covered within the scope of the Opinions. \\nMoreover, the IRS could successfully appeal the portions of the Opinions that are favorable to the Company and/or assert new \\nclaims for additional tax relating to the subsequent years by broadening the scope to cover additional foreign licensees. These \\nadjustments could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. \\nAny such adjustments related to years prior to 2018, either in the litigation period or thereafter, may also have an impact on the \\ntransition tax payable as part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform Act”). For additional information regarding the \\ntax litigation, refer to Part I, “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” of this report.\\nIncreased or new indirect taxes could negatively affect our business. \\nOur business operations are subject to numerous duties or taxes that are not based on income, sometimes referred to as “indirect \\ntaxes,” including import duties, tariffs, excise taxes, sales or value-added taxes, taxes on sweetened or aerated beverages, \\npackaging taxes, carbon taxes, property taxes and payroll taxes, in many of the jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, in \\nthe past, the U.S. Congress considered imposing a federal excise tax on beverages sweetened with sugar, HFCS or other \\n19\\nnutritive sweeteners and may consider similar proposals in the future. As federal, state and local governments in the United \\nStates and throughout the world experience significant budget deficits, some lawmakers have singled out beverages among a \\nplethora of revenue-raising items and have imposed or increased, or proposed to impose or increase, sales or similar taxes on \\nbeverages, particularly sweetened beverages and alcohol beverages, as well as packaging and/or packaging materials. Increases \\nin or the imposition of new indirect taxes on our business operations or products would increase the cost of products or, to the \\nextent levied directly on consumers, make our products less affordable, which may negatively impact our net operating \\nrevenues and profitability. \\nChanges in laws and regulations relating to beverage containers and packaging could increase our costs and reduce \\ndemand for our products. \\nWe and our bottlers offer, among other beverage containers, nonrefillable containers in the United States and in various other \\nmarkets around the world. Legal requirements have been enacted in various jurisdictions requiring that deposits or certain \\necotaxes or fees be charged in connection with the sale, marketing and use of certain beverage containers. Other proposals \\nrelating to beverage container deposits, recycling, recycling content, tethered bottle caps, ecotax and/or product stewardship, or \\nprohibitions on certain types of plastic products, packages and cups (including packaging containing PFAS) have been \\nintroduced and/or adopted in various jurisdictions, and we anticipate that similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in \\nthe future at federal, state and local levels, both in the United States and elsewhere. Consumers’ increased concerns and \\nchanging attitudes about solid waste streams and environmental responsibility and the related publicity could result in the \\nadoption of additional such legislation or regulations in the future. If these types of requirements are adopted and implemented \\non a large scale, they could affect our costs or require changes in our distribution model, which could reduce our net operating \\nrevenues and profitability. \\nSignificant additional labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products may inhibit \\nsales of affected products. \\nVarious jurisdictions have adopted, and may seek to adopt, significant additional product labeling or warning requirements or \\nlimitations on the marketing or sale of our products because of what they contain or allegations that they cause adverse health \\neffects. If these types of requirements become applicable to one or more of our products under current or future environmental \\nor health laws or regulations, they may inhibit sales of such products or make it necessary for us to reformulate certain of our \\nproducts, resulting in adverse effects on our business.\\nFor example, under one such law in California, known as Proposition 65, if the state has determined that a substance causes \\ncancer or harms human reproduction or development, a warning must be provided for any product sold in the state that exposes \\nconsumers to that substance, unless the exposure falls under an established safe harbor level or another exemption is applicable. \\nFor additional information regarding Proposition 65, refer to the heading “Governmental Regulation” set forth in Part I,     \\n“Item 1. Business” of this report. If we were required to add Proposition 65 warnings on the labels of one or more of our \\nbeverage products produced for sale in California, the resulting consumer reaction to the warnings and potential adverse \\npublicity could negatively affect our sales both in California and in other markets. \\nLitigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and damage our reputation. \\nWe are party to various litigation claims and legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, \\nthose arising out of our advertising and marketing practices, product claims and labels, competition, distribution and pricing, \\npersonal data protection and privacy, intellectual property and commercial disputes, tax disputes, and environmental and \\nemployment matters. We evaluate these litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes \\nand to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we establish reserves and/\\nor disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings, as appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on the \\ninformation available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of management judgment. Actual outcomes \\nor losses may differ materially from our current assessments and estimates. \\nWe conduct business in markets with high-risk legal compliance environments, which exposes us to increased legal and \\nreputational risk. \\nWe have bottling and other business operations in markets with high-risk legal compliance environments. Our policies and \\nprocedures require strict compliance by our employees and agents with all United States and local laws and regulations and \\nconsent orders applicable to our business operations, including those prohibiting improper payments to government officials. \\nNonetheless, our policies, procedures and related training programs may not always ensure full compliance by our employees \\nand agents with all applicable legal requirements. Improper conduct by our employees or agents could damage our reputation in \\nthe United States and internationally or lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties, \\nincluding substantial monetary fines as well as disgorgement of profits. \\n20\\nFailure to adequately protect, or disputes relating to, trademarks, formulas and other intellectual property rights could harm \\nour business. \\nOur trademarks, formulas and other intellectual property rights (refer to the heading “Patents, Copyrights, Trade Secrets and \\nTrademarks” in Part I, “Item 1. Business” of this report) are essential to the success of our business. We cannot be certain that \\nthe legal steps we are taking around the world are sufficient to protect our intellectual property rights or that, notwithstanding \\nlegal protection, others do not or will not infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property rights. If we fail to adequately \\nprotect our intellectual property rights, or if changes in laws diminish or remove the current legal protections available to them, \\nthe competitiveness of our products may be eroded and our business could suffer. In addition, we could come into conflict with \\nthird parties over intellectual property rights, which could result in disruptive and expensive litigation. Any of the foregoing \\ncould harm our business. \\nChanges in, or failure to comply with, the laws and regulations applicable to our products or our business operations could \\nincrease our costs or reduce our net operating revenues. \\nOur Company is subject to various laws and regulations in the countries and territories throughout the world in which we do \\nbusiness, including laws and regulations relating to competition, distribution and pricing, product safety, product design, \\nadvertising and labeling, container deposits, recycling, recycled content, product stewardship, the protection of the \\nenvironment, occupational health and safety, employment and labor practices, machine learning and artificial intelligence, \\npersonal data protection and privacy, and data security. For additional information regarding laws and regulations applicable to \\nour business, refer to the heading “Governmental Regulation” set forth in Part I, “Item 1. Business” of this report. Changes in \\napplicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof, changes in enforcement priorities of regulators, and differing \\nor competing regulations and standards across the markets where our products or raw materials are made, manufactured, \\ndistributed or sold, have in the past resulted in, and could continue to result in, higher compliance costs, higher capital \\nexpenditures and higher production costs, or make it necessary for us to reformulate certain of our products, resulting in adverse \\neffects on our business. In addition, increased or additional regulations to limit and/or report carbon dioxide and other \\ngreenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change; to discourage the use of plastic materials, including \\nregulations relating to recovery and/or disposal of plastic bottles and other packaging materials due to environmental concerns; \\nto limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns; or to address wastewater \\ndischarge to protect local bodies of water, have in the past and could continue to result in increased compliance costs, capital \\nexpenditures and other financial obligations for us and our bottling partners, which could affect our profitability, or may impede \\nthe production, distribution, marketing and sale of our products, which could affect our net operating revenues. Failure to \\ncomply with various laws and regulations (or allegations thereof), such as U.S. trade sanctions, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt \\nPractices Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control trade sanction regulations and anti-boycott regulations; antitrust and \\ncompetition laws; anti-modern slavery laws; anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws; data privacy laws, including the European \\nUnion’s General Data Protection Regulation and China’s Personal Information Protection Law; tax laws and regulations; and a \\nvariety of other applicable local, national and multinational regulations and laws, could result in litigation or criminal or civil \\nenforcement actions, including voluntary and involuntary document requests, the assessment of damages, the imposition of \\npenalties, the suspension of production or distribution, costly changes to equipment or processes due to required corrective \\naction, or the cessation or interruption of operations at our or our bottling partners’ facilities, as well as damage to our or our \\nbottling partners’ image and reputation, all of which could harm our or our bottling partners’ profitability. \\nRISKS RELATED TO FINANCE, ACCOUNTING AND INVESTMENTS \\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. \\nWe earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using many currencies other than the U.S. dollar. \\nIn 2023, we derived $29.2 billion of net operating revenues from operations outside the United States. Because our consolidated \\nfinancial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and \\nliabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or \\ndecreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies affect our net operating revenues, operating income and the \\nvalue of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Global events, including political instability, international \\nconflicts, trade disputes, economic sanctions, inflation, increasing interest rates and emerging market volatility, and the \\nresulting uncertainties, may cause currencies to fluctuate in relation to the U.S. dollar. Due to the geographic diversity of our \\noperations, weakness in some currencies may be offset by strength in other currencies over time. We also use derivative \\nfinancial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. However, fluctuations in \\nforeign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies or the currencies of \\nlarge developing countries, could materially affect our financial results. \\nIf interest rates increase, our net income could be negatively affected. \\nWe maintain levels of debt that we consider prudent based on our cash flows, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to \\ncapital. We use debt financing to lower our cost of capital, which increases our return on shareowners’ equity. This exposes us \\n21\\nto adverse changes in interest rates. When and to the extent appropriate, we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our \\nexposure to interest rate risks. However, our financial risk management program may not be successful in reducing the risks \\ninherent in exposures to interest rate fluctuations. On December 31, 2021, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, \\nthe governing body responsible for regulating the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), ceased to publish certain LIBOR \\nreference rates. Other LIBOR reference rates, including U.S. dollar overnight, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month \\nmaturities, ceased to be published in July 2023. As a result of the discontinuation of LIBOR, we have amended our LIBOR-\\nreferencing agreements to either reference the Secured Overnight Financing Rate or include mechanics for selecting an \\nalternative rate, but it is possible that these changes may have an adverse impact on our financing costs as compared to LIBOR \\nin the long term. Our interest expense may also be affected by our credit ratings. In assessing our credit strength, credit rating \\nagencies consider our capital structure and financial policies as well as the consolidated balance sheet and other financial \\ninformation of the Company. In addition, some credit rating agencies also consider financial information of certain of our major \\nbottling partners. It is our expectation that the credit rating agencies will continue using this methodology. If our credit ratings \\nwere to be downgraded as a result of changes in our capital structure; our major bottling partners’ financial performance; \\nchanges in the credit rating agencies’ methodology in assessing our credit strength; the credit agencies’ perception of the impact \\nof credit market conditions on our or our major bottling partners’ current or future financial performance and financial \\ncondition; or for any other reason, our cost of borrowing could increase. Additionally, if the credit ratings of certain bottling \\npartners in which we have equity method investments were to be downgraded, such bottling partners’ interest expense could \\nincrease, which would reduce our equity income. \\nIf we are unable to achieve our overall long-term growth objectives, the value of an investment in our Company could be \\nnegatively affected. \\nWe have established and publicly announced certain long-term growth objectives. These objectives are based on, among other \\nthings, our evaluation of our growth prospects, which are generally driven by the sales potential of our many beverage products, \\nsome of which are more profitable than others, and on an assessment of the potential price and product mix. We may not be \\nable to realize the sales potential and the price and product mix necessary to achieve our long-term growth objectives. \\nDefault by or failure of one or more of our counterparty financial institutions could cause us to incur significant losses. \\nAs part of our hedging activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments, including forward \\ncontracts, commodity futures contracts, option contracts, collars and swaps, with various financial institutions. In addition, we \\nhave significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial \\ninstitutions in the United States and abroad. As a result, we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty \\nfinancial institutions. The risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of \\nuncertainty in the financial markets. If one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to \\nrecover losses incurred as a result of default or to retrieve our assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such \\ncounterparty may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy \\nproceedings. In the event of default by or failure of one or more of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which \\ncould negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. \\nWe may be required to recognize impairment charges that could materially affect our financial results. \\nWe assess our noncurrent assets, including trademarks, goodwill and other intangible assets, equity method investments and \\nother long-lived assets, as and when required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States to determine \\nwhether they are impaired and, if they are, we record appropriate impairment charges. Our equity method investees also \\nperform similar recoverability and impairment tests, and we record our proportionate share of impairment charges recorded by \\nthem adjusted, as appropriate, for the impact of items such as basis differences, deferred taxes and deferred gains. It is possible \\nthat we may be required to record significant impairment charges or our proportionate share of significant impairment charges \\nrecorded by equity method investees in the future and, if we do so, our net income could be materially adversely affected.\\nRISKS RELATED TO CYBERSECURITY AND DATA PRIVACY\\nIf we are unable to protect our information systems against service interruption, misappropriation of data or cybersecurity \\nincidents, our operations could be disrupted, we may suffer financial losses and our reputation may be damaged. \\nWe rely on networks and information systems and other technology (“information systems”), including the Internet and third-\\nparty hosted services, to support a variety of business processes and activities, including procurement and supply chain, \\nmanufacturing, distribution, invoicing and collection of payments, employee processes, consumer marketing, mergers and \\nacquisitions, and research and development. We use information systems to process financial information and results of \\noperations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting and legal and tax requirements. In \\naddition, we depend on information systems for digital marketing activities and electronic communications among our locations \\naround the world and between Company employees and our bottlers, customers, suppliers, consumers and other third parties. \\nBecause information systems are critical to many of the Company’s operating activities, our business may be impacted by \\n22\\nsystem shutdowns, service disruptions or cybersecurity incidents. These incidents may be caused by failures during routine \\noperations, such as system upgrades, or by user errors, as well as network or hardware failures, malicious or disruptive \\nsoftware, unintentional or malicious actions of employees or contractors, cyberattacks by hackers, criminal groups or nation-\\nstate organizations (which may include deepfake or social engineering schemes, ransomware and other forms of malware, \\nbusiness email compromise, cyber extortion, denial of service, or attempts to exploit vulnerabilities or gain unauthorized \\naccess), geopolitical events, natural disasters, failures or impairments of telecommunications networks, or other catastrophic \\nevents. Cybercriminals have increasingly demonstrated advanced capabilities, such as use of zero-day vulnerabilities, and rapid \\nintegration of new technology such as generative artificial intelligence. In addition, cybersecurity incidents could result in \\nunauthorized or accidental access to or disclosure of material confidential information or regulated personal data. If our \\ninformation systems or third-party information systems on which we rely suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our \\nbusiness continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in reporting our \\nfinancial results, and we may lose revenue and profits as a result of our inability to timely manufacture, distribute, invoice and \\ncollect payments for concentrates or finished products. Unauthorized or accidental access to, or destruction, loss, alteration, \\ndisclosure, falsification or unavailability of, information, or unauthorized access to machines and equipment could result in \\nviolations of data protection laws and regulations, misuse or malfunction of machines and equipment, damage to the reputation \\nand credibility of the Company, loss of opportunities to acquire or divest of businesses or brands, and loss of ability to \\ncommercialize products developed through research and development efforts and, therefore, could have a negative impact on \\nnet operating revenues. In addition, we may suffer financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated \\nconfidential information belonging to us, our current or former employees, our bottling partners, other customers or suppliers, \\nor consumers or other data subjects, and may become exposed to legal action and increased regulatory oversight, including \\ngovernmental investigations, enforcement actions and regulatory fines. The Company could also be required to spend \\nsignificant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a cybersecurity incident or to repair or replace \\nnetworks and information systems. These risks are also present with respect to our bottling partners, distributors, joint venture \\npartners and suppliers that generally use separate information systems, not integrated with the information systems of the \\nCompany, and that have cybersecurity programs and processes that differ in scope and complexity from our overall \\ncybersecurity programs and processes. While we have established a third-party risk management program to address security \\nrisks, including relating to our bottling partners, our ability to monitor their security measures is limited, and we may \\nexperience secondary contractual, regulatory financial and reputational harm as a result of cybersecurity attacks, phishing \\nattacks, viruses, malware, ransomware, hacking or similar breaches experienced by our bottling partners. These risks may also \\nbe present to the extent a business or bottler we have acquired, but which does not use our information systems, experiences \\nsevere damage, a system shutdown, service disruption or a cybersecurity incident.\\nLike most major corporations, the Company’s information systems are a target of attacks. In addition, third-party providers of \\ndata hosting or cloud services, as well as our bottling partners, distributors, joint venture partners, suppliers or acquired \\nbusinesses that use separate information systems, may experience cybersecurity incidents that may involve data we share with \\nthem. Although the cybersecurity incidents that we have experienced to date, as well as those reported to us by our third-party \\npartners, have not had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, such incidents could have a \\nmaterial adverse effect on us in the future. In order to address risks to our information systems, we continue to make \\ninvestments in personnel, technologies and training. Data protection laws and regulations around the world often require \\n“reasonable,” “appropriate” or “adequate” technical and organizational security measures, and the interpretation and application \\nof those laws and regulations are often uncertain and evolving; there can be no assurance that our security measures will be \\ndeemed adequate, appropriate or reasonable by a regulator or court. Moreover, even security measures that are deemed \\nadequate, appropriate, reasonable or in accordance with applicable legal requirements may not protect the information we \\nmaintain against increasingly sophisticated attacks. In addition to potential fines, we could be subject to mandatory corrective \\naction due to a cybersecurity incident, which could adversely affect our business operations and result in substantial costs for \\nyears to come. While we have purchased cybersecurity insurance, there are no assurances that the coverage would be adequate \\nin relation to any incurred losses. Moreover, as cyberattacks increase in frequency and magnitude, we may be unable to obtain \\ncybersecurity insurance in types and amounts we view as appropriate for our operations.\\nIf we fail to comply with privacy and data protection laws, we could be subject to adverse publicity, business disruption, data \\nloss, government enforcement actions and/or private litigation, any of which could negatively affect our business and \\noperating results. \\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we receive, process, transmit and store information relating to identifiable individuals \\n(“personal data”), including employees, former employees, vendors, third-party personnel, customers and consumers with \\nwhom we interact. As a result, we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in \\nnumerous jurisdictions regarding privacy and data protection. These privacy and data protection laws may include different \\nstandards and obligations or may be interpreted and applied differently from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may create \\ninconsistent or conflicting requirements. In addition, new legislation in this area may be enacted in other jurisdictions at any \\ntime or may revise the law in jurisdictions that already have privacy regulations. These laws impose operational requirements \\n23\\nfor companies receiving or processing personal data, and many provide for significant penalties for noncompliance. Some laws \\nand regulations also impose obligations regarding cross-border data transfers of personal data. These requirements with respect \\nto personal data have subjected and may continue in the future to subject the Company to, among other things, additional costs \\nand expenses and have required and may in the future require costly changes to our business practices and information \\ntechnology and security systems, policies, procedures and practices. In addition, some countries are considering or have enacted \\ndata localization or residency laws, which require that certain data be maintained, stored and/or processed within their country \\nof origin. Maintaining local data centers in individual countries could increase our operating costs significantly. Our security \\ncontrols over personal data, the training of employees and vendors on data privacy and data security, and the policies, \\nprocedures and practices we have implemented or may implement in the future may not prevent the improper disclosure of \\npersonal data by us or the third-party service providers and vendors whose technology, systems and services we use in \\nconnection with the receipt, storage and transmission of personal data. Our bottling partners, distributors, joint venture partners \\nand suppliers have privacy and security controls and policies over personal data that differ in scope and complexity from our \\npolicies, procedures and practices, and we may also experience secondary contractual, regulatory, financial and reputational \\nharm as a result of improper disclosure of personal data by our bottling partners. Unauthorized access to or improper disclosure \\nof personal data in violation of privacy and data protection laws could harm our reputation, cause loss of consumer confidence, \\nsubject us to regulatory enforcement actions (including penalties, fines and investigations), and result in private litigation \\nagainst us, which could result in loss of revenue, increased costs, liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal \\nprosecution, all of which could negatively affect our business and operating results. We have incurred, and will continue to \\nincur, expenses to comply with privacy and data protection standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry \\nstandards and contractual obligations. Increased regulation of data collection, use, disclosure and retention practices, including \\nself-regulation and industry standards, changes in existing laws and regulations, enactment of new laws and regulations, \\nincreased enforcement activity, and changes in interpretation of laws, could increase our cost of compliance and operation, limit \\nour ability to grow our business or otherwise harm our business.\\nRISKS RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL FACTORS \\nOur business is subject to evolving sustainability regulatory requirements and expectations, which exposes us to increased \\ncosts and legal and reputational risks.\\nWe have established and publicly announced sustainability goals and aspirations. We also report progress related to the circular \\neconomy of packaging; water stewardship; climate; portfolio; sustainable agriculture; human and workplace rights and \\ndiversity, equity and inclusion. These goals reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able \\nto achieve them. Our ability to achieve our sustainability goals and targets and to accurately and transparently report our \\nprogress presents numerous operational, financial, legal and other risks and is dependent on the actions of our bottling partners, \\nsuppliers and other third parties, some of which are outside of our control. If we are unable to meet our sustainability goals or \\nevolving stakeholder expectations and industry standards, or if we are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the \\ngrowing concern for sustainability issues, our reputation, and therefore our ability to sell products, could be negatively \\nimpacted. In addition, in recent years, investor advocacy groups and certain institutional investors have placed increasing \\nimportance on sustainability. If, as a result of their assessment of our sustainability practices, certain investors are unsatisfied \\nwith our actions or progress, they may reconsider their investment in our Company. At the same time, there also exists “anti-\\nESG” sentiment among certain stakeholders and government institutions, and we may face scrutiny, reputational risk, product \\nboycotts, lawsuits or market access restrictions from these parties regarding our sustainability initiatives. \\nIncreasing focus on sustainability matters has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, evolving legal and regulatory \\nrequirements, including mandatory due diligence, disclosure and reporting requirements, as well as a variety of voluntary \\ndisclosure frameworks and standards. We have incurred, and are likely to continue to incur, increased costs complying with \\nsuch standards and regulations, particularly given the lack of convergence among standards. In addition, our processes and \\ncontrols may not always comply with evolving standards and regulations for identifying, measuring and reporting sustainability \\nmetrics; our interpretation of reporting standards and regulations may differ from those of others; and such standards and \\nregulations may change over time, any of which could result in significant revisions to our goals or reported progress in \\nachieving such goals. In addition, methodologies for reporting our data may be updated and previously reported data may be \\nadjusted to reflect improvement in availability and quality of third-party data, changing assumptions, changes in the nature and \\nscope of our operations (including from acquisitions and divestitures), and other changes in circumstances. Any failure or \\nperceived failure, whether or not valid, to pursue or fulfill our sustainability goals and aspirations or to satisfy various \\nsustainability reporting standards or regulatory requirements within the timelines we announce, or at all, could increase the risk \\nof litigation or result in regulatory actions.\\nIncreasing concerns about the environmental impact of plastic bottles and other packaging materials could result in reduced \\ndemand for our beverage products and increased production and distribution costs. \\nThere are increasing concerns among consumers, governments and other stakeholders about the damaging impact of the \\naccumulation of plastic bottles and other packaging materials in the environment, particularly in the world’s waterways, lakes \\n24\\nand oceans, as well as inefficient use of resources when packaging materials are not included in a circular economy. We and our \\nbottling partners sell certain of our beverage products in plastic bottles and use other packaging materials that, while largely \\nrecyclable, may not be regularly recovered and recycled due to lack of collection and recycling infrastructure. If we and our \\nbottling partners do not, or are perceived not to, act responsibly to address plastic materials recoverability and recycling \\nconcerns and associated waste management issues, our corporate image and brand reputation could be damaged, which may \\ncause some consumers to reduce or discontinue consumption of some of our beverage products. In addition, from time to time \\nwe establish and publicly announce goals and targets to reduce the Coca-Cola system’s impact on the environment by, for \\nexample, increasing our use of recycled content in our packaging materials; increasing our use of packaging materials that are \\nmade in part of plant-based renewable materials; expanding our use of reusable packaging (including refillable or returnable \\nglass and plastic bottles, as well as dispensed and fountain delivery models where consumers use refillable containers for our \\nbeverages); participating in programs and initiatives to reclaim or recover bottles and other packaging materials that are already \\nin the environment; and taking other actions and participating in other programs and initiatives organized or sponsored by \\nnongovernmental organizations and other groups. If we and our bottling partners fail to achieve or improperly report on our \\nprogress toward achieving our announced environmental goals and targets, the resulting negative publicity could adversely \\naffect consumer preference for our products. In addition, in response to environmental concerns, governmental entities in the \\nUnited States and in many other jurisdictions around the world have adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations and \\npolicies designed to mandate or encourage plastic packaging waste reduction and an increase in recycling rates and/or recycled \\ncontent minimums, or, in some cases, restrict or even prohibit the use of certain plastic containers or packaging materials. These \\nregulations and policies, whatever their scope or form, could increase the cost of our beverage products or otherwise put the \\nCompany at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, our increased focus on reducing plastic containers and other packaging \\nmaterials waste has in the past and may continue to require us or our bottling partners to incur additional expenses and to \\nincrease our capital expenditures. A reduction in consumer demand for our products and/or an increase in costs and \\nexpenditures relating to production and distribution as a result of these environmental concerns regarding plastic bottles and \\nother packaging materials could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. \\nWater scarcity and poor quality could negatively impact the Coca-Cola system’s costs and capacity. \\nWater is a main ingredient in substantially all of our products, is vital to the production of the agricultural ingredients on which \\nour business relies and is needed in our manufacturing process. It also is critical to the prosperity of the communities we serve \\nand the ecosystems in which we operate. Water is a limited resource in many parts of the world, facing unprecedented \\nchallenges from overexploitation, increasing demand for food and other consumer and industrial products whose manufacturing \\nprocesses require water, increasing pollution and emerging awareness of potential contaminants, poor management, lack of \\nphysical or financial access to water, sociopolitical tensions due to lack of public infrastructure in certain areas of the world and \\nthe effects of climate change. As the demand for water continues to increase around the world, and as water becomes scarcer \\nand the quality of available water deteriorates, the Coca-Cola system may incur higher costs or face capacity constraints and the \\npossibility of reputational damage, which could adversely affect our profitability. \\nIncreased demand for food products, decreased agricultural productivity and increased regulation of ingredient sourcing \\ndue diligence may negatively affect our business. \\nAs part of the manufacture of our beverage products, we and our bottling partners use a number of key ingredients that are \\nderived from agricultural commodities such as sugarcane, corn, sugar beets, citrus, coffee and tea. Increased demand for food \\nproducts; decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions of the world as a result of changing weather patterns; loss of \\nbiodiversity; increased agricultural regulations, including regulation of ingredient sourcing due diligence; and other factors have \\nin the past, and may in the future, limit the availability and/or increase the cost of such agricultural commodities and could \\nimpact the food security of communities around the world. If we are unable to implement programs focused on economic \\nopportunity and environmental sustainability to address these agricultural challenges and fail to make a strategic impact on food \\nsecurity through joint efforts with bottlers, farmers, communities, suppliers and key partners, as well as through our increased \\nand continued investment in sustainable agriculture, our ability to source raw materials for use in our manufacturing processes \\nand the affordability of our products and ultimately our business and results of operations could be negatively impacted. \\nClimate change and legal or regulatory responses thereto may have a long-term adverse impact on our business and results \\nof operations. \\nThere is increasing concern that a gradual increase in global average temperatures due to increased concentration of carbon \\ndioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is causing significant changes in weather patterns around the globe and \\nan increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters. Decreased agricultural productivity in certain regions of the world \\nas a result of changing weather patterns may limit the availability or increase the cost of key agricultural commodities, such as \\nsugarcane, corn, sugar beets, citrus, coffee and tea, which are important ingredients for our products, and could impact the food \\nsecurity of communities around the world. Climate change may also exacerbate extreme weather, resulting in water scarcity or \\nflooding, and cause a further deterioration of water quality in affected regions, which could limit water availability for the \\nCoca-Cola system’s bottling operations. Increased frequency or duration of extreme weather conditions could also impair \\n25\\nproduction capabilities, disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products. Increasing concern over climate change \\nalso may result in additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to reduce or mitigate the effects of carbon dioxide and \\nother greenhouse gas emissions on the environment, and/or may result in increased disclosure obligations. Increased energy or \\ncompliance costs and expenses due to increased legal or regulatory requirements may cause disruptions in, or an increase in the \\ncosts associated with, the manufacturing and distribution of our beverage products. The physical effects and transition costs of \\nclimate change and legal, regulatory or market initiatives to address climate change could have a long-term adverse impact on \\nour business and results of operations. In addition, from time to time we establish and publicly announce goals and targets to \\nreduce the Coca-Cola system’s carbon footprint by increasing our use of recycled packaging materials, expanding our \\nrenewable energy usage, and participating in environmental and sustainability programs and initiatives organized or sponsored \\nby nongovernmental organizations and other groups to reduce greenhouse gas emissions industrywide. If we and our bottling \\npartners fail to achieve or improperly report on our progress toward achieving our carbon footprint reduction goals and targets, \\nthe resulting negative publicity could adversely affect consumer preference for our beverage products. \\nAdverse weather conditions could reduce the demand for our products. \\nThe sales of our products are influenced to some extent by weather conditions in the markets in which we operate. Unusually \\ncold or rainy weather during the summer months may have a temporary effect on the demand for our products and contribute to \\nlower sales, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations for such periods. \\nITEM 1B.  UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\\nNot applicable.\\nITEM 1C.  CYBERSECURITY\\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\\nWe face various cyber risks, including, but not limited to, risks related to unauthorized access, misuse, data theft, computer \\nviruses, system disruptions, ransomware, malicious software and other intrusions. We utilize a multilayered, proactive approach \\nto identify, evaluate, mitigate and prevent potential cyber and information security threats through our cybersecurity risk \\nmanagement program. Our cybersecurity risk management program is integrated into our broader Enterprise Risk Management \\n(“ERM”) program, which is designed to identify, assess, prioritize and mitigate risks across the organization to enhance our \\nresilience and support the achievement of our strategic objectives. This integrated approach helps ensure that cyber risks are not \\nviewed in isolation, but are assessed, prioritized and managed in alignment with the Company’s operational, financial and \\nstrategic risks, assisting the Company in more effectively managing interdependencies among risks and enhancing risk \\nmitigation strategies.\\nWe devote significant resources to protecting the security of our computer systems, software, networks and other technology \\nassets. Our efforts are designed to adapt with the evolution of information security risks and appropriate best practices and \\ninclude physical, administrative and technical safeguards. Our practices are generally developed from, and benchmarked \\nagainst, recognized cybersecurity frameworks, such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity \\nFramework. Our newly acquired businesses and consolidated bottling operations maintain separate cybersecurity programs and \\nprocesses that may differ in scope and complexity from the Company’s overall cybersecurity programs and processes. \\nHowever, for all consolidated entities, our cybersecurity risk management program is designed to help coordinate the \\nCompany’s identification of, response to and recovery from, cybersecurity incidents and includes processes to triage, assess the \\nseverity of, escalate, contain, investigate and remediate incidents, as well as to comply with applicable legal obligations. \\nOur internal audit team assesses the effectiveness of our internal controls relating to cybersecurity. Our management team also \\nengages certain outside advisors and consultants to assist in the identification, oversight, evaluation and management of \\ncybersecurity risks on a regular basis, as well as to advise on specific topics. For example, we conduct tests that help discover \\npotential vulnerabilities, including external penetration testing and tabletop and other exercises, to evaluate our core information \\nsystems and cybersecurity practices that enable improved decision-making and prioritization, as well as to promote monitoring \\nand reporting across compliance functions. As part of our overall risk mitigation strategy, the Company also maintains cyber \\ninsurance coverage; however, such insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to \\nsecurity breaches, cyberattacks and other related breaches.\\nIn order to oversee and identify risks from cybersecurity threats associated with the Company’s independent bottling partners, \\ndistributors, wholesalers, retailers and other business partners, as well as our use of third-party service providers, we maintain a \\nthird-party risk management program designed to help protect against the misuse of information technology. We have various \\nprocesses and procedures to evaluate cybersecurity threats associated with third parties, including requiring key third-party \\nservice providers to complete initial and periodic security assessments. In addition, our Global Chief Information Security \\nOfficer (“CISO”) and other senior leaders regularly meet with key bottling partners to discuss cybersecurity risks and \\n26\\nmitigation programs in order to advance risk management capabilities and proactively share cybersecurity guidelines and best \\npractices. \\nWe have not identified any cybersecurity threats that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our \\nbusiness strategy, results of our operations, or financial condition. However, we have been the target of cyber attacks and \\nexpect them to continue as cybersecurity threats have been rapidly evolving in sophistication and becoming more prevalent in \\nthe industry. We cannot eliminate all risks from cybersecurity threats or provide assurances that we have not experienced an \\nundetected cybersecurity incident in the past or that we will not experience such an incident in the future. For more information \\non the risks from cybersecurity threats that we face, refer to Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”\\nCybersecurity Governance and Oversight\\nThe Company’s cybersecurity risk management program is supervised by our CISO, who reports directly to the Company’s \\nChief Information Officer (“CIO”). The CISO and his team are responsible for leading enterprise-wide cybersecurity strategy, \\npolicy, standards, architecture and processes. Our current CISO received his Master of Business Administration degree from \\nColumbia University and has over 20 years of cybersecurity experience, including relevant prior senior leadership positions \\nheld with three other large companies.\\nThe CISO chairs the Company’s Cybersecurity Oversight Council, a cross-functional management committee that drives \\nawareness, ownership and alignment across broad governance and risk stakeholder groups for effective cybersecurity risk \\nmanagement. The Cybersecurity Oversight Council is sponsored by the Company’s Global General Counsel and CIO and is \\ncomposed of senior leaders from our privacy, legal, information technology, cybersecurity, internal audit and global security \\nand asset protection functions, among others. Subject matter experts are also invited, as appropriate. The Cybersecurity \\nOversight Council meets at least quarterly and has responsibility for oversight and validation of the Company’s cybersecurity \\nstrategic direction, risks and threats, priorities, resource allocation, capabilities and planning. The Cybersecurity Oversight \\nCouncil acts in alignment with the Company’s Risk Steering Committee, another cross-functional management committee, \\nwhich provides strategic direction and oversight over the Company’s ERM program. The CISO and his team, as well as the \\nCybersecurity Oversight Council, are informed about and monitor the prevention, detection, mitigation and remediation of \\ncybersecurity incidents in accordance with the Company’s cyber incident response plan.\\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is charged with oversight of cybersecurity matters and receives regular reports \\nfrom the CISO and the CIO on, among other things, the Company’s cyber risks and threats, the status of projects to strengthen \\nthe Company’s information security systems, assessments of the Company’s security program and the emerging threat \\nlandscape. In accordance with our cyber incident response plan, the Audit Committee is promptly informed by management of \\ncybersecurity incidents with the potential to materially adversely affect the Company or its information systems and is regularly \\nupdated about incidents with lesser impact potential. The Chair of the Audit Committee regularly briefs the full Board on these \\nmatters. In addition, the Board also periodically receives cybersecurity updates directly from management. \\nIn an effort to detect and defend against cyber threats, the Company annually provides its employees with various cybersecurity \\nand data protection training programs. These programs cover timely and relevant topics, including social engineering, phishing, \\npassword protection, confidential data protection, asset use and mobile security, and educate employees on the importance of \\nreporting all incidents promptly to the Company’s centrally managed cyber defense and security operations. \\nITEM 2.  PROPERTIES\\nOur worldwide headquarters is located on a 35-acre complex in Atlanta, Georgia. The complex includes several office buildings \\nwhich are used by Corporate employees and North America operating segment employees. In addition, the complex includes \\ntechnical and engineering facilities along with a reception center. \\nWe own or lease additional facilities, real estate and office space throughout the world, which we use for administrative, \\nmanufacturing, processing, packaging, storage, warehousing, distribution and retail operations. These properties are generally \\nincluded in the geographic operating segment in which they are located, with the exception of our Costa retail stores, which are \\nincluded in the Global Ventures operating segment, and facilities related to our consolidated bottling and distribution \\noperations, which are included in the Bottling Investments operating segment. \\n27\\nThe following table summarizes our principal production facilities, distribution and storage facilities, and retail stores by \\noperating segment and Corporate as of December 31, 2023:\\nPrincipal Concentrate \\nand/or Syrup Plants\\nPrincipal Beverage \\nManufacturing/\\nBottling Plants\\nPrincipal Distribution \\nand Storage Facilities\\nPrincipal Retail Stores\\nOwned\\nLeased\\nOwned\\nLeased\\nOwned\\nLeased\\nOwned\\nLeased\\nEurope, Middle East & Africa\\n \\n5  \\n— \\n \\n2  \\n—  \\n7  \\n27  \\n—  \\n13 \\nLatin America\\n \\n5  \\n— \\n \\n—  \\n—  \\n2  \\n6  \\n—  \\n— \\nNorth America\\n \\n10  \\n— \\n \\n6  \\n3  \\n—  \\n39  \\n—  \\n5 \\nAsia Pacific\\n \\n7  \\n— \\n \\n3  \\n—  \\n3  \\n4  \\n—  \\n— \\nGlobal Ventures\\n \\n1  \\n— \\n \\n2  \\n—  \\n—  \\n8  \\n—  \\n1,575 \\nBottling Investments\\n \\n—  \\n— \\n \\n81  \\n4  \\n104  \\n112  \\n—  \\n— \\nCorporate\\n \\n3  \\n— \\n \\n—  \\n—  \\n—  \\n5  \\n—  \\n— \\nTotal\\n \\n31  \\n— \\n \\n94  \\n7  \\n116  \\n201  \\n—  \\n1,593 \\nManagement believes that our Company’s facilities used for the production of our products are suitable and adequate, that they \\nare being appropriately utilized in line with past experience, and that they have sufficient production capacity for their present \\nintended purposes. The extent of utilization of our production facilities varies based upon seasonal demand for our products. \\nHowever, management believes that, with the exception of certain dairy products that require specialized equipment, additional \\nproduction can be achieved at the existing facilities by adding personnel and capital equipment or, at some facilities, by adding \\nshifts of personnel or expanding the facilities. The Company is in the process of increasing our dairy production capacity. We \\ncontinuously review our anticipated requirements for facilities and, on the basis of that review, may from time to time acquire \\nor lease additional facilities and/or dispose of existing facilities.\\nITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\\nThe Company is involved in various legal proceedings, including the proceedings specifically discussed below. Management\\nbelieves that, except as disclosed in “U.S. Federal Income Tax Dispute” below, the total liabilities of the Company that may \\narise as a result of currently pending legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company taken as a whole.\\nAqua-Chem Litigation\\nOn December 20, 2002, the Company filed a lawsuit (The Coca-Cola Company v. Aqua-Chem, Inc., Civil Action No. \\n2002CV631-50) in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia (“Georgia Case”), seeking a declaratory judgment that the \\nCompany has no obligation to its former subsidiary, Aqua-Chem, Inc., now known as Cleaver-Brooks, Inc. (“Aqua-Chem”), for \\nany past, present or future liabilities or expenses in connection with any claims or lawsuits against Aqua-Chem. Subsequent to \\nthe Company’s filing but on the same day, Aqua-Chem filed a lawsuit (Aqua-Chem, Inc. v. The Coca-Cola Company, Civil \\nAction No. 02CV012179) in the Circuit Court, Civil Division of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin (“Wisconsin Case”). In the \\nWisconsin Case, Aqua-Chem sought a declaratory judgment that the Company is responsible for all liabilities and expenses not \\ncovered by insurance in connection with certain of Aqua-Chem’s general and product liability claims arising from occurrences \\nprior to the Company’s sale of Aqua-Chem in 1981, and a judgment for breach of contract in an amount exceeding $9 million \\nfor costs incurred by Aqua-Chem to date in connection with such claims. The Wisconsin Case initially was stayed, pending \\nfinal resolution of the Georgia Case, and later was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice by Aqua-Chem. \\nThe Company owned Aqua-Chem from 1970 to 1981. During that time, the Company purchased over $400 million of insurance \\ncoverage, which also insures Aqua-Chem for some of its prior and future costs for certain product liability and other claims. \\nThe Company sold Aqua-Chem to Lyonnaise American Holding, Inc., in 1981 under the terms of a stock sale agreement. The \\n1981 agreement, and a subsequent 1983 settlement agreement, outlined the parties’ rights and obligations concerning past and \\nfuture claims and lawsuits involving Aqua-Chem. Cleaver-Brooks, a division of Aqua-Chem, manufactured boilers, some of \\nwhich contained asbestos gaskets. Aqua-Chem was first named as a defendant in asbestos lawsuits in or around 1985 and \\ncurrently has approximately 15,000 active claims pending against it.\\nThe parties agreed in 2004 to stay the Georgia Case pending the outcome of insurance coverage litigation filed by certain Aqua-\\nChem insurers on March 26, 2004. In the coverage action, five plaintiff insurance companies filed suit (Century Indemnity \\nCompany, et al. v. Aqua-Chem, Inc., The Coca-Cola Company, et al., Case No. 04CV002852) in the Circuit Court, Civil \\nDivision of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, against the Company, Aqua-Chem and 16 insurance companies. Several of the \\npolicies that were the subject of the coverage action had been issued to the Company during the period (1970 to 1981) when the \\nCompany owned Aqua-Chem. The complaint sought a determination of the respective rights and obligations under the \\ninsurance policies issued with regard to asbestos-related claims against Aqua-Chem. The action also sought a monetary \\n28\\njudgment reimbursing any amounts paid by the plaintiffs in excess of their obligations. Two of the insurers, one with a \\n$15 million policy limit and one with a $25 million policy limit, asserted cross-claims against the Company, alleging that the \\nCompany and/or its insurers are responsible for Aqua-Chem’s asbestos liabilities before any obligation is triggered on the part \\nof the cross-claimant insurers to pay for such costs under their policies.\\nAqua-Chem and the Company filed and obtained a partial summary judgment determination in the coverage action that the \\ninsurers for Aqua-Chem and the Company were jointly and severally liable for coverage amounts, but reserving judgment on \\nother defenses that might apply. During the course of the Wisconsin insurance coverage litigation, Aqua-Chem and the \\nCompany reached settlements with several of the insurers, including plaintiffs, who paid funds into escrow accounts for \\npayment of costs arising from the asbestos claims against Aqua-Chem. On July 24, 2007, the Wisconsin trial court entered a \\nfinal declaratory judgment regarding the rights and obligations of the parties under the insurance policies issued by the \\nremaining defendant insurers, which judgment was not appealed. The judgment directs, among other things, that each insurer \\nwhose policy is triggered is jointly and severally liable for 100% of Aqua-Chem’s losses up to policy limits. The court’s \\njudgment concluded the Wisconsin insurance coverage litigation. \\nThe Company and Aqua-Chem continued to pursue and obtain coverage agreements for the asbestos-related claims against \\nAqua-Chem with those insurance companies that did not settle in the Wisconsin insurance coverage litigation. The Company \\nanticipated that a final settlement with three of those insurers (“Chartis insurers”) would be finalized in May 2011, but the \\nChartis insurers repudiated their settlement commitments and, as a result, Aqua-Chem and the Company filed suit against them \\nin Wisconsin state court to enforce the coverage-in-place settlement or, in the alternative, to obtain a declaratory judgment \\nvalidating Aqua-Chem and the Company’s interpretation of the court’s judgment in the Wisconsin insurance coverage \\nlitigation. \\nIn February 2012, the parties filed and argued a number of cross-motions for summary judgment related to the issues of the \\nenforceability of the settlement agreement and the exhaustion of policies underlying those of the Chartis insurers. The court \\ngranted defendants’ motions for summary judgment that the 2011 Settlement Agreement and 2010 Term Sheet were not \\nbinding contracts, but denied their similar motions related to plaintiffs’ claims for promissory and/or equitable estoppel. On or \\nabout May 15, 2012, the parties entered into a mutually agreeable settlement/stipulation resolving two major issues: exhaustion \\nof underlying coverage and control of defense. On or about January 10, 2013, the parties reached a settlement of the estoppel \\nclaims and all of the remaining coverage issues, with the exception of one disputed issue relating to the scope of the Chartis \\ninsurers’ defense obligations in two policy years. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the Company and \\nAqua-Chem on that one open issue and entered a final appealable judgment to that effect following the parties’ settlement. On \\nJanuary 23, 2013, the Chartis insurers filed a notice of appeal of the trial court’s summary judgment ruling. On October 29, \\n2013, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals affirmed the grant of summary judgment in favor of the Company and Aqua-Chem. On \\nNovember 27, 2013, the Chartis insurers filed a petition for review in the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, and on December 11, \\n2013, the Company filed its opposition to that petition. On April 16, 2014, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin denied the Chartis \\ninsurers’ petition for review. \\nThe Georgia Case remains subject to the stay agreed to in 2004. \\nU.S. Federal Income Tax Dispute\\nOn September 17, 2015, the Company received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (“Notice”) from the IRS seeking \\napproximately $3.3 billion of additional federal income tax for years 2007 through 2009. In the Notice, the IRS stated its intent \\nto reallocate over $9 billion of income to the U.S. parent company from certain of its foreign affiliates that the U.S. parent \\ncompany licensed to manufacture, distribute, sell, market and promote its products in certain non-U.S. markets.\\nThe Notice concerned the Company’s transfer pricing between its U.S. parent company and certain of its foreign affiliates. IRS \\nrules governing transfer pricing require arm’s-length pricing of transactions between related parties such as the Company’s U.S. \\nparent and its foreign affiliates.\\nTo resolve the same transfer pricing issue for the tax years 1987 through 1995, the Company and the IRS had agreed in 1996 on \\nan arm’s-length methodology for determining the amount of U.S. taxable income that the U.S. parent company would report as \\ncompensation from its foreign licensees. The Company and the IRS memorialized this accord in a closing agreement resolving \\nthat dispute (“Closing Agreement”). The Closing Agreement provided that, absent a change in material facts or circumstances \\nor relevant federal tax law, in calculating the Company’s income taxes going forward, the Company would not be assessed \\npenalties by the IRS for using the agreed-upon tax calculation methodology that the Company and the IRS agreed would be \\nused for the 1987 through 1995 tax years.\\nThe IRS audited and confirmed the Company’s compliance with the agreed-upon Closing Agreement methodology in five \\nsuccessive audit cycles for tax years 1996 through 2006.\\n29\\nThe September 17, 2015, Notice from the IRS retroactively rejected the previously agreed-upon methodology for the 2007 \\nthrough 2009 tax years in favor of an entirely different methodology, without prior notice to the Company. Using the new tax \\ncalculation methodology, the IRS reallocated over $9 billion of income to the U.S. parent company from its foreign licensees \\nfor tax years 2007 through 2009. Consistent with the Closing Agreement, the IRS did not assert penalties, and it has yet           \\nto do so.\\nThe IRS designated the Company’s matter for litigation on October 15, 2015. Litigation designation is an IRS determination \\nthat forecloses to a company any and all alternative means for resolution of a tax dispute. As a result of the IRS’ designation of \\nthe Company’s matter for litigation, the Company was forced to either accept the IRS’ newly imposed tax assessment and pay \\nthe full amount of the asserted tax or litigate the matter in the federal courts. The matter remains subject to the IRS’ litigation \\ndesignation, preventing the Company from any attempt to settle or otherwise mutually resolve the matter with the IRS.\\nThe Company consequently initiated litigation by filing a petition in the Tax Court in December 2015, challenging the tax \\nadjustments enumerated in the Notice.\\nPrior to trial, the IRS increased its transfer pricing adjustment by $385 million, resulting in an additional tax adjustment of \\n$135 million. The Company obtained a summary judgment in its favor on a different matter related to Mexican foreign tax \\ncredits, which thereafter effectively reduced the IRS’ potential tax adjustment by $138 million.\\nThe trial was held in the Tax Court from March through May 2018, and final post-trial briefs were filed and exchanged in April \\n2019.\\nOn November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued the Opinion in which it predominantly sided with the IRS but agreed with the \\nCompany that dividends previously paid by the foreign licensees to the U.S. parent company in reliance upon the Closing \\nAgreement should continue to be allowed to offset royalties, including those that would become payable to the Company in \\naccordance with the Opinion. On November 8, 2023, the Tax Court issued a supplemental opinion, siding with the IRS in \\nconcluding both that the blocked-income regulations apply to the Company’s operations and that the Tax Court opinion in     \\n3M Co. & Subs. v. Commissioner (February 9, 2023) controlled as to the validity of those regulations.\\nThe Company believes that the IRS and the Tax Court misinterpreted and misapplied the applicable regulations in reallocating \\nincome earned by the Company’s foreign licensees to increase the Company’s U.S. tax. Moreover, the Company believes that \\nthe retroactive imposition of such tax liability using a calculation methodology different from that previously agreed upon by \\nthe IRS and the Company, and audited by the IRS for over a decade, is unconstitutional. The Company intends to assert its \\nclaims on appeal and vigorously defend its position.\\nIn determining the amount of tax reserve to be recorded as of December 31, 2020, the Company completed the required two-\\nstep evaluation process prescribed by Accounting Standards Codification 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. In doing so, we \\nconsulted with outside advisors, and we reviewed and considered relevant laws, rules, and regulations, including, but not \\nlimited to, the Opinions and relevant caselaw. We also considered our intention to vigorously defend our positions and assert \\nour various well-founded legal claims via every available avenue of appeal. We concluded, based on the technical and legal \\nmerits of the Company’s tax positions, that it is more likely than not the Company’s tax positions will ultimately be sustained \\non appeal. In addition, we considered a number of alternative transfer pricing methodologies, including the methodology \\nasserted by the IRS and affirmed in the Opinions (“Tax Court Methodology”), that could be applied by the courts upon final \\nresolution of the litigation. Based on the required probability analysis, we determined the methodologies we believe the federal \\ncourts could ultimately order to be used in calculating the Company’s tax. As a result of this analysis, we recorded a tax reserve \\nof $438 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the application of the resulting methodologies as well as \\nthe different tax treatment applicable to dividends originally paid to the U.S. parent company by its foreign licensees, in \\nreliance upon the Closing Agreement, that would be recharacterized as royalties in accordance with the Opinions and the \\nCompany’s analysis.\\nThe Company’s conclusion that it is more likely than not the Company’s tax positions will ultimately be sustained on appeal is \\nunchanged as of December 31, 2023. However, we updated our calculation of the methodologies we believe the federal courts \\ncould ultimately order to be used in calculating the Company’s tax. As a result of the application of the required probability \\nanalysis to these updated calculations and the accrual of interest through the current reporting period, we updated our tax \\nreserve as of December 31, 2023 to $439 million.\\nWhile the Company strongly disagrees with the IRS’ positions and the portions of the Opinions affirming such positions, it is \\npossible that some portion or all of the adjustment proposed by the IRS and sustained by the Tax Court could ultimately be \\nupheld. In that event, the Company would likely be subject to significant additional liabilities for tax years 2007 through 2009, \\nand potentially also for subsequent years, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position, \\nresults of operations and cash flows.\\nThe Company calculated the potential impact of applying the Tax Court Methodology to reallocate income from foreign \\nlicensees potentially covered within the scope of the Opinions, assuming such methodology were to be ultimately upheld by the \\n30\\ncourts, and the IRS were to decide to apply that methodology to subsequent years, with consent of the federal courts. This \\nimpact would include taxes and interest accrued through December 31, 2023 for the 2007 through 2009 litigated tax years and \\nfor subsequent tax years from 2010 through 2023. The calculations incorporated the estimated impact of correlative adjustments \\nto the previously accrued transition tax payable under the Tax Reform Act. The Company estimates that the potential aggregate \\nincremental tax and interest liability could be approximately $16 billion as of December 31, 2023. Additional income tax and \\ninterest would continue to accrue until the time any such potential liability, or portion thereof, were to be paid. We currently \\nproject the continued application of the Tax Court Methodology in future years, assuming similar facts and circumstances as of \\nDecember 31, 2023, would result in an incremental annual tax liability that would increase the Company’s effective tax rate by \\napproximately 3.5%.\\nThe Company and the IRS are now in the process of agreeing on the tax impacts of the Opinions. Subsequent to the completion \\nof this process, the Tax Court will render a decision in the case. The Company will have 90 days thereafter to file a notice of \\nappeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. The IRS will then seek to collect, and the Company expects to \\npay, any additional tax related to the 2007 through 2009 tax years reflected in the Tax Court decision (and interest thereon). The \\nCompany currently estimates that the payment to be made at that time related to the 2007 through 2009 tax years, which is \\nincluded in the above estimate of the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability, would be approximately \\n$5.8 billion (including interest accrued through December 31, 2023), plus any additional interest accrued through the time of \\npayment. Some or all of this amount, plus accrued interest, would be refunded if the Company were to prevail on appeal.\\nITEM 4.  MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\\nNot applicable.\\nITEM X.

We own or license and market numerous beverage brands, \\nwhich we group into the following categories: Trademark Coca-Cola; sparkling flavors; water, sports, coffee and tea; juice, \\nvalue-added dairy and plant-based beverages; and emerging beverages. We own and market several of the world’s largest \\nnonalcoholic sparkling soft drink brands, including Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and Diet Coke/Coca-Cola \\nLight.\\nWe make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of independent \\nbottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and retailers as well as the Company’s consolidated bottling and distribution \\noperations. Beverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to us account for 2.2 billion of the estimated 64 billion servings \\nof all beverages consumed worldwide every day.\\nWe believe our success depends on our ability to connect with consumers by providing them with a wide variety of beverage \\noptions to meet their desires, needs and lifestyles. Our success further depends on the ability of our people to execute \\neffectively, every day.\\nOur Company operates in two lines of business: concentrate operations and finished product operations.\\nOur concentrate operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as \\n“beverage bases,” syrups, including fountain syrups, and certain finished beverages to authorized bottling operations (to which \\nwe typically refer as our “bottlers” or our “bottling partners”). Our bottling partners either combine concentrates with still or \\nsparkling water and sweeteners (depending on the product), or combine syrups with still or sparkling water, to produce finished \\nbeverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers, such as cans and refillable and nonrefillable glass and \\nplastic bottles, bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, \\nthrough wholesalers or other bottlers. In addition, outside the United States, our bottling partners are typically authorized to \\nmanufacture fountain syrups, using our concentrates, which they sell to fountain retailers for use in producing beverages for \\nimmediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain \\nretailers. Our concentrate operations are included in our geographic operating segments and our Global Ventures operating \\nsegment.\\nOur finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling soft drinks and a variety of other finished \\nbeverages to retailers, or to distributors and wholesalers who in turn sell the beverages to retailers. Generally, finished product \\noperations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations. These operations \\nconsist primarily of our consolidated bottling and distribution operations, which are included in our Bottling Investments \\noperating segment. In certain markets, the Company also operates non-bottling finished product operations in which we sell \\nfinished beverages to distributors and wholesalers that are generally not one of the Company’s bottling partners. These \\noperations are generally included in one of our geographic operating segments or our Global Ventures operating segment. \\nAdditionally, we sell directly to consumers through retail stores operated by Costa. These sales are included in our Global \\nVentures operating segment. In the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers, who use \\nthe fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners \\nwho in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. These fountain syrup sales are included in our North \\nAmerica operating segment. \\n35\\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of total net operating revenues attributable to concentrate operations and finished \\nproduct operations:\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\nConcentrate operations\\n 58% \\n 56% \\nFinished product operations\\n 42 \\n 44 \\nTotal\\n 100% \\n 100% \\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of total worldwide unit case volume attributable to concentrate operations and \\nfinished product operations:\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\nConcentrate operations\\n 83% \\n 82% \\nFinished product operations\\n 17 \\n 18 \\nTotal\\n 100% \\n 100% \\nWe operate in the highly competitive commercial beverage industry. We face strong competition from numerous other general \\nand specialty beverage companies. We, along with other beverage companies, are affected by a number of factors, including, \\nbut not limited to, the cost to manufacture and distribute products, consumer spending, economic conditions, availability and \\nquality of water, consumer preferences, inflation, geopolitical conditions including international conflicts, local and national \\nlaws and regulations, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, fuel prices, weather patterns and health crises. \\nDespite the dynamic world in which we are currently operating, we believe we are well positioned to create value for our \\nCompany and our stakeholders. In an effort to support our future growth, we are continuing to invest in our portfolio of brands, \\nour strategic capabilities and our people. We are focused on the following strategic priorities: unlocking the potential of our \\nportfolio of strong global, regional and scaled local brands; developing a robust innovation pipeline focusing on scalable \\ninitiatives; increasing consumer-centric marketing effectiveness and efficiency; winning in the marketplace with aligned data-\\ndriven revenue growth management and execution capabilities; and further embedding sustainability goals into our operations. \\nChallenges and Risks\\nBeing a global enterprise provides unique opportunities for our Company. Challenges and risks accompany those opportunities. \\nOur management has identified certain challenges and risks that demand the attention of our Company and the commercial \\nbeverage industry. Of these, six key strategic business challenges and risks are discussed below.\\nObesity\\nObesity continues to impact individuals, communities and countries worldwide. There is concern among consumers, public \\nhealth professionals and governments about the health problems associated with obesity. This concern represents a significant \\nchallenge to our industry. We understand that obesity is a complex public health challenge, and we are committed to being a \\npart of the solution.\\nWe recognize the uniqueness of consumers’ lifestyles and dietary choices. Therefore, we continue to:\\n• offer an expanded portfolio of beverage choices, including reduced-, low- and no-calorie beverage options; \\n• provide transparent nutrition information, featuring calories on the front of most of our packages;\\n• provide our beverages in a range of packaging sizes, including small sizes to enable portion control; and\\n• market responsibly, including no advertising targeted to children under 13.\\nThe heritage of our Company is to lead, and innovation is critical for leadership. As such, we are resolute in continuing to \\ninnovate and are committed to partnering with suppliers to invest in research and development of new noncaloric sweeteners \\nand flavors that help us create the best tasting beverages, including options with low or no calories. We want to be a helpful and \\ncredible partner in the fight against obesity. Across the Coca-Cola system, we are mobilizing our assets in marketing and in \\ncommunity outreach to increase awareness and spur action.\\nEvolving Consumer Product Preferences\\nWe are impacted by shifting consumer demographics and needs, on-the-go lifestyles and consumers who are empowered with \\nmore information than ever. As a consequence of these changes, many consumers want more beverage choices, personalization, \\na focus on sustainability, and transparency related to our products and packaging. We are committed to meeting changing \\nconsumer needs and to generating growth through our evolving portfolio of beverage brands and products (including numerous \\n36\\nlow- and no-calorie products); selectively expanding into other profitable categories of the commercial beverage industry; \\ninvesting in innovative and sustainable packaging; and including easy-to-access information about our beverages on our \\nwebsite. \\nEvolving Competitive Landscape and Competing in the Digital Marketplace \\nOur Company faces strong competition from well-established global companies as well as numerous regional and local \\ncompanies. Additionally, the rapidly evolving digital landscape and growth of e-commerce in many markets has led to dramatic \\nshifts in consumer shopping habits and patterns. Consumers are rapidly embracing shopping via mobile device applications,    \\ne-commerce retailers and e-commerce websites or platforms, which presents new challenges to maintain the competitiveness \\nand relevancy of our brands. As a result, we must continuously strengthen our capabilities in marketing and innovation to \\ncompete in a digital environment and maintain brand loyalty and market share. In addition, we are increasing our investments in \\ne-commerce to support retail and meal delivery services, offering more package sizes that are fit-for-purpose for online sales \\nand shifting more consumer and trade promotions to digital.\\nProduct Safety and Quality\\nWe strive to meet the highest standards in both product safety and product quality. We are aware that some consumers have \\nconcerns and negative viewpoints regarding certain ingredients used in our products. We only use ingredients that are \\nauthorized for use by regulatory authorities in each of the markets in which we operate. The Coca-Cola system works every day \\nto produce high-quality, safe and refreshing beverages for consumers around the world. We have rigorous product and \\ningredient safety and quality standards designed to ensure safety and quality in each of our products, and we drive innovation \\nthat provides new beverage options to satisfy consumers’ evolving needs and preferences. \\nWe work to ensure consistent safety and quality through strong governance and compliance with applicable regulations and \\nstandards. We stay current with new regulations, industry best practices and marketplace conditions, and we engage with \\nstandard-setting and industry organizations. Additionally, we manufacture and distribute our products according to strict \\npolicies, requirements and specifications set forth in an integrated quality management program that continually measures all \\noperations within the Coca-Cola system against the same stringent standards. Our quality management program also identifies \\nand mitigates risks and drives improvement. In our quality laboratories, we stringently measure the quality attributes of \\ningredients as well as samples of finished products collected from the marketplace. \\nWe perform due diligence to ensure that product and ingredient safety and quality standards are maintained in the more than \\n200 countries and territories where our products are sold. We regularly assess the relevance of our requirements and standards \\nand continually work to improve and refine them across our entire supply chain.\\nSustainability Matters\\nInvestors and stakeholders increasingly focus on sustainability matters. We acknowledge that we have a role to play in \\ndeveloping and implementing solutions that help build resilience across our business. We report our sustainability progress in \\nthe following areas: circular economy of packaging; water stewardship; climate; portfolio; sustainable agriculture; human and \\nworkplace rights and diversity, equity and inclusion. Our ability to achieve our sustainability goals is dependent on many \\nfactors, including, but not limited to, our actions along with the actions of various stakeholders, such as our bottling partners, \\nsuppliers, governments, nongovernmental organizations, communities, and other third parties, some of which are outside of our \\ncontrol.\\nTalent Acquisition and Retention\\nCompetition for existing and prospective personnel has increased, especially in light of changing worker expectations and talent \\nmarketplace variability regarding flexible work models. In addition, the broader labor market is experiencing a shortage of \\nqualified workers, which has further increased competition for qualified employees that we want and may require for our future \\nbusiness needs.  \\nOur people and our culture are critical business priorities, and we strive to be a global employer of choice that attracts and \\nretains high-performing talent with the passion, skills and mindsets to drive us on our purpose to refresh the world and make a \\ndifference. We are committed to building an equitable and inclusive culture that inspires and supports the growth of our \\nemployees, serves our communities and shapes a strong and more sustainable business. \\nSee “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in Part I of this report for additional information about risks and uncertainties facing our Company.\\n37\\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United \\nStates (“U.S. GAAP”), which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts \\nreported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We believe our most critical accounting policies and \\nestimates relate to the following:\\n• Principles of Consolidation\\n• Recoverability of Equity Method Investments and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\\n• Pension Plan Valuations\\n• Revenue Recognition\\n• Income Taxes\\nManagement has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the \\nAudit Committee of our Company’s Board of Directors. While our estimates and assumptions are based on our knowledge of \\ncurrent events and on actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates and \\nassumptions. For a discussion of the Company’s significant accounting policies, refer to Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements.\\nPrinciples of Consolidation\\nOur Company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest. Additionally, there are \\nsituations in which consolidation is required even though the usual condition of consolidation (i.e., ownership of a majority \\nvoting interest) does not apply. Generally, this occurs when an entity holds an interest in another business enterprise that was \\nachieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests, which results in a disproportionate relationship between \\nsuch entity’s voting interests in, and its exposure to the economic risks and potential rewards of, the other business enterprise. \\nThis disproportionate relationship results in what is known as a variable interest, and the entity in which another entity holds a \\nvariable interest is referred to as a “VIE.” An enterprise must consolidate a VIE if it is determined to be the primary beneficiary \\nof the VIE. The primary beneficiary has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the \\nentity’s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could \\npotentially be significant to the VIE.\\nOur Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling operations, for which we were not determined to be the \\nprimary beneficiary. Our variable interests in these VIEs primarily relate to equity investments, profit guarantees or \\nsubordinated financial support. Refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Although these financial \\narrangements resulted in our holding variable interests in these entities, they did not empower us to direct the activities of the \\nVIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs’ economic performance. Creditors of our VIEs do not have recourse against the \\ngeneral credit of the Company, regardless of whether the VIEs are accounted for as consolidated entities.\\nWe use the equity method to account for investments in companies if our investment provides us with the ability to exercise \\nsignificant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee. Our consolidated net income includes our \\nCompany’s proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies. Our judgment regarding the level of influence \\nover each equity method investee includes considering key factors, such as our ownership interest, representation on the board \\nof directors, participation in policy-making decisions, other commercial arrangements and material intercompany transactions.\\nWe eliminate from our financial results all significant intercompany transactions, including the intercompany transactions with \\nconsolidated VIEs and the intercompany portion of transactions with equity method investees.\\nRecoverability of Equity Method Investments and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets \\nOur Company faces many uncertainties and risks related to various economic, political and regulatory environments in the \\ncountries and territories in which we operate, particularly in developing and emerging markets. Refer to the heading “Our \\nBusiness — Challenges and Risks” above and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in Part I of this report as well as the heading \\n“Operations Review” below for additional information related to our present business environment. As a result, management \\nmust make numerous assumptions, which involve a significant amount of judgment, when performing impairment tests of \\nequity method investments and indefinite-lived intangible assets in various regions around the world. The performance of \\nimpairment tests involves critical accounting estimates. These estimates require significant management judgment and include \\ninherent uncertainties. Factors that management must estimate include, among others, the economic lives of the assets, sales \\nvolume, pricing, royalty rates, cost of raw materials, delivery costs, long-term growth rates, discount rates, marketing spending, \\nforeign currency exchange rates, tax rates, capital spending and proceeds from the sale of assets. The variability of these factors \\n38\\ndepends on a number of conditions, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period. These factors are \\neven more difficult to estimate when global financial markets are highly volatile. As these factors are often interdependent and \\nmay not change in isolation, we do not believe it is practicable or meaningful to present the impact of changing a single factor. \\nIf we had used other assumptions and estimates when impairment tests were performed, impairment charges could have \\nresulted. Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions in future periods, or if different conditions exist in future \\nperiods, impairment charges could result. The total future impairment charges we may be required to record could be material.\\nEquity Method Investments\\nEquity method investments are reviewed for impairment whenever significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that \\nthe carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. When such events or changes occur, we evaluate the fair value \\ncompared to our cost basis in the investment. The fair values of most of our Company’s investments in publicly traded \\ncompanies are readily available based on quoted market prices. For investments in nonpublicly traded companies, \\nmanagement’s assessment of fair value is based on various valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flows, estimates \\nof sales proceeds, and appraisals, as appropriate. We consider the assumptions that we believe a market participant would use in \\nevaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or estimates of sales proceeds valuation \\nmethodologies. The ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in emerging and developing markets, may impact \\nthe determination of fair value. In the event the fair value of an investment declines below our cost basis, management is \\nrequired to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. If management determines the decline is other than \\ntemporary, an impairment charge is recorded. Management’s assessment as to the nature of a decline in fair value is based on, \\namong other things, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our cost basis; the financial \\ncondition and near-term prospects of the issuer; and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient \\nto allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a \\ndiscussion of impairment charges, if applicable. \\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets \\nImpairment tests for indefinite-lived intangible assets must be performed at least annually, or more frequently if events or \\ncircumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. Our Company performs the annual impairment tests as of the first day of \\nour third fiscal quarter. We perform impairment tests using various valuation methodologies, including discounted cash flow \\nmodels and a market approach, to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset or the reporting unit, as \\napplicable. The ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in emerging and developing markets, may impact the \\ndetermination of fair value. When performing these impairment tests, we estimate the fair values of the assets using \\nmanagement’s best assumptions, which we believe are consistent with those a market participant would use. The estimates and \\nassumptions used in these tests are evaluated and updated as appropriate.\\nFor indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge \\nis recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of indefinite-\\nlived intangible assets, other than goodwill, rather than completing the impairment test. The Company must assess whether it is \\nmore likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes that \\nthis is the case, it must perform the impairment testing described above. \\nWe perform impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level, which is generally one level below our operating \\nsegments. Our operating segments are primarily based on geographic responsibility, which is consistent with the way \\nmanagement runs our business. Our geographic operating segments are generally subdivided into smaller geographic regions. \\nThese geographic regions are our reporting units. Our Global Ventures operating segment includes the results of our Costa, \\ninnocent and doğadan businesses, as well as fees earned pursuant to distribution coordination agreements between the Company \\nand Monster, each of which is its own reporting unit. The Bottling Investments operating segment includes all of our \\nconsolidated bottling operations, regardless of geographic location. Generally, each consolidated bottling operation within our \\nBottling Investments operating segment is its own reporting unit. Goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or units that benefit \\nfrom the synergies arising from each business combination.\\nIn order to test for goodwill impairment, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, \\nincluding goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is written down for the \\namount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. However, the impairment charge recognized \\ncannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The assumptions used in our impairment testing models are consistent with \\nthose we believe a market participant would use. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill \\nrather than completing the impairment test. The Company must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of \\nthe reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the \\nimpairment testing discussed above. Otherwise, the Company does not need to perform any further assessment.\\n39\\nIntangible assets acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment, because they are recorded at fair \\nvalue based on recent operating plans and macroeconomic conditions present at the time of acquisition. Consequently, if \\noperating results and/or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate shortly after an acquisition, it could result in the impairment of \\nthe acquired assets. A deterioration of macroeconomic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash \\nflows used in our cash flow models but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses, including, but not \\nlimited to, the discount rates. If the discount rates change, our Company may recognize an impairment of an intangible asset in \\nspite of realizing actual cash flows that are equal to, or greater than, our previously forecasted amounts. Refer to Note 2 of \\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent acquisitions, if applicable.\\nIn November 2021, the Company acquired the remaining 85% ownership interest in, and now owns 100% of BodyArmor, \\nwhich offers a line of sports performance and hydration beverages. The Company allocated $4.2 billion of the purchase price to \\nthe BodyArmor trademark. As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of this trademark approximates its carrying value. If the \\nnear-term operating results of this trademark do not achieve our current financial projections, or if the macroeconomic \\nconditions change causing the discount rate to increase without an offsetting increase in the operating results, it is likely that we \\nwould be required to recognize an impairment charge. Management will continue to monitor the fair value of this trademark in \\nfuture periods.\\nPension Plan Valuations\\nOur Company sponsors a qualified pension plan covering substantially all U.S. employees as well as unfunded nonqualified \\npension plans for certain employees in the United States. In addition, our Company and its subsidiaries have various pension \\nplans outside the United States.\\nManagement is required to make certain critical estimates related to the actuarial assumptions used to determine our pension \\nobligations and our net periodic pension cost or income. We believe the two most critical assumptions are the discount rate and \\nthe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Our actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually, or more frequently to the \\nextent that a settlement or curtailment occurs. Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement \\nof our pension obligations and our net periodic pension cost or income.\\nThe discount rate assumption used to account for pension plans reflects the rate at which the benefit obligations could be \\neffectively settled. The discount rate for U.S. and certain non-U.S. plans is determined using a matching technique whereby the \\nrates of a yield curve, developed from high-quality debt securities, are applied to projected benefit cash flows to determine the \\nappropriate effective discount rate. For other non-U.S. plans, we base the discount rate assumption on comparable indices \\nwithin each of the respective countries. The Company measures the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic \\npension cost or income by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plans’ projected cash flows. \\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based upon the long-term outlook of our investment strategy as well as \\nour historical returns and volatilities for each asset class. We also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess \\nthe reasonableness of our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Our investment objective for our pension assets is to \\nensure all funded pension plans have sufficient assets to meet their benefit obligations when they become due. As a result, the \\nCompany periodically revises asset allocations, where appropriate, to seek to improve returns and manage risk. \\nIn 2023, the Company’s total cost related to pension plans was $120 million, which included $38 million of net periodic \\npension cost and net charges of $82 million, primarily due to settlements and special termination benefits. In 2024, we expect \\nour net periodic pension cost to be approximately $51 million. The increase in net periodic pension cost is primarily due to the \\nnet impact of the decrease in the weighted-average discount rate at December 31, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022. \\nAs of December 31, 2023, the U.S. qualified pension plan represented 63% and 56% of the Company’s consolidated projected \\nbenefit obligation and pension plan assets, respectively. For this plan, we estimate that a 50 basis-point decrease in the discount \\nrate would result in an $8 million increase in our 2024 net periodic pension cost, and we estimate that a 50 basis-point decrease \\nin the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would result in a $19 million increase in our 2024 net periodic pension \\ncost.\\nRefer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our pension plans and related \\nactuarial assumptions. \\nRevenue Recognition\\nRevenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contracts with our customers are satisfied. Our \\nperformance obligation generally consists of the promise to sell concentrates, syrups or finished products to our bottling \\npartners, wholesalers, distributors or retailers. Control of the concentrates, syrups or finished products is transferred upon \\nshipment to, or receipt at, our customers’ locations, as determined by the specific terms of the contract. Upon transfer of control \\nto the customer, which completes our performance obligation, revenue is recognized. Our sales terms generally do not allow for \\n40\\na right of return except for matters related to any manufacturing defects on our part. After completion of our performance \\nobligation, we have an unconditional right to consideration as outlined in the contract. Our receivables will generally be \\ncollected in less than six months, in accordance with the underlying payment terms. All of our performance obligations under \\nthe terms of contracts with our customers have an original duration of one year or less.\\nIn most markets, in an effort to allow our Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned \\nfinancial objectives and the flexibility necessary to meet consumers’ always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented \\nan incidence-based concentrate pricing model. Under this model, the concentrate price we charge is impacted by a number of \\nfactors, including, but not limited to, bottler pricing, the channels in which the finished products produced from the concentrates \\nare sold, and package mix. The amounts associated with the arrangements described above represent variable consideration, an \\nestimate of which is included in the transaction price as a component of net operating revenues in our consolidated statement of \\nincome upon completion of our performance obligations. The total revenue recorded, including any variable consideration, \\ncannot exceed the amount for which it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur when uncertainties related to \\nvariability are resolved. As a result, we are recognizing revenue based on our faithful depiction of the consideration that we \\nexpect to receive. In making our estimates of variable consideration, we consider past results and make significant assumptions \\nrelated to: (1) customer sales volumes; (2) customer ending inventories; (3) customer selling price per unit; (4) selling channels; \\nand (5) discount rates, rebates and other pricing allowances, as applicable. In gathering data to estimate our variable \\nconsideration, we generally calculate our estimates using a portfolio approach at the country and product line level rather than \\nat the individual contract level. The result of making these estimates will impact the line items trade accounts receivable or \\naccounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet, as applicable. The actual amounts ultimately paid \\nand/or received may be different from our estimates.\\nIncome Taxes \\nOur annual effective tax rate is based on our income and the tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. \\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our annual income tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions. We \\nestablish reserves to remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that the position \\nbecomes uncertain based upon one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is not “more likely than not” to be sustained; \\n(2) the tax position is “more likely than not” to be sustained, but for a lesser amount; or (3) the tax position is “more likely than \\nnot” to be sustained, but not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken. For purposes of evaluating \\nwhether or not a tax position is uncertain, (1) we presume the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that \\nhas full knowledge of all relevant information; (2) the technical merits of a tax position are derived from authorities such as \\nlegislation and statutes, legislative intent, regulations, rulings and caselaw and their applicability to the facts and circumstances \\nof the tax position; and (3) each tax position is evaluated without consideration of the possibility of offset or aggregation with \\nother tax positions taken. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of \\nchanging facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. Refer to the heading “Operations Review — Income \\nTaxes” below and Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\\nA number of years may elapse before a particular uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved. The number of years \\nsubject to tax audits or tax assessments varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously \\nreserved because of a failure to meet the “more likely than not” recognition threshold would be recognized in income tax \\nexpense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax \\nposition is “more likely than not” to be sustained; (2) the tax position, amount and/or timing is ultimately settled through \\nnegotiation or litigation; or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue \\nwould usually require the use of cash. Refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\\nTax laws require certain items to be included in the tax return at different times than when these items are reflected in the \\nconsolidated financial statements. As a result, the annual effective tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is \\ndifferent from that reported in our tax return (our cash tax rate). Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that \\nare not deductible in our tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. Deferred tax assets \\nand liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The \\ntax rates used to determine deferred tax assets or liabilities are the enacted tax rates in effect for the year and for the manner in \\nwhich the differences are expected to reverse. Based on the evaluation of all available information, the Company recognizes \\nfuture tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered more likely \\nthan not.\\nWe evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing our forecasted taxable income \\nusing both historical and projected future operating results; the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences; taxable \\nincome in prior carryback years (if permitted); and the availability of tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is required \\n41\\nto be established unless management determines that it is more likely than not that the Company will ultimately realize the tax \\nbenefit associated with a deferred tax asset.\\nThe Company does not record a U.S. deferred tax liability for the excess of the book basis over the tax basis of its investments \\nin foreign subsidiaries to the extent that the basis difference meets the indefinite reversal criteria. These criteria are met if the \\nforeign subsidiary has invested, or will invest, the undistributed earnings indefinitely. The decision as to the amount of \\nundistributed earnings that the Company intends to maintain in non-U.S. subsidiaries takes into account various items, \\nincluding, but not limited to, forecasts and budgets of financial needs of cash for working capital, liquidity plans, capital \\nimprovement programs, merger and acquisition plans, and planned loans to other non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company also \\nevaluates its expected cash requirements in the United States. Other factors that can influence that determination are local \\nrestrictions on remittances (for example, in some countries a central bank application and approval are required in order for the \\nCompany’s local country subsidiary to pay a dividend), economic stability and asset risk. Refer to Note 15 of Notes to \\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\\nOPERATIONS REVIEW\\nOur organizational structure consists of the following operating segments: Europe, Middle East and Africa; Latin America; \\nNorth America; Asia Pacific; Global Ventures; and Bottling Investments. Our operating structure also includes Corporate, \\nwhich consists of a center and a platform services organization. For additional information regarding our operating segments \\nand Corporate, refer to Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\\nStructural Changes, Acquired Brands and Newly Licensed Brands\\nIn order to continually improve upon the Company’s operating performance, from time to time, we engage in buying and \\nselling ownership interests in bottling partners and other manufacturing operations. In addition, we periodically acquire brands \\nand their related operations or enter into license agreements for certain brands to supplement our beverage offerings. These \\nitems impact our operating results and certain key metrics used by management in assessing the Company’s performance.\\nUnit case volume growth is a key metric used by management to evaluate the Company’s performance because it measures \\ndemand for our products at the consumer level. The Company’s unit case volume represents the number of unit cases (or unit \\ncase equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to \\ncustomers or consumers and, therefore, reflects unit case volume for both consolidated and unconsolidated bottlers. Refer to the \\nheading “Beverage Volume” below.\\nConcentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances \\nexpressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished products sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other \\ncustomers. For Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, concentrate sales volume represents the amount of beverages, \\nprimarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents), sold by the Company to \\ncustomers or consumers. Refer to the heading “Beverage Volume” below.\\nWhen we analyze our net operating revenues, we generally consider the following factors: (1) volume growth (concentrate sales \\nvolume or unit case volume, as applicable); (2) changes in price, product and geographic mix; (3) foreign currency exchange \\nrate fluctuations; and (4) acquisitions and divestitures (including structural changes as defined below), as applicable. Refer to \\nthe heading “Net Operating Revenues” below. The Company sells concentrates and syrups to both consolidated and \\nunconsolidated bottling partners. The ownership structure of our bottling partners impacts the timing of recognizing concentrate \\nrevenue and concentrate sales volume. When we sell concentrates or syrups to our consolidated bottling partners, we do not \\nrecognize the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume until the bottling partner has sold finished products \\nmanufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party. When we sell concentrates or syrups to our unconsolidated \\nbottling partners, we recognize the concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume when the concentrates or syrups are sold \\nto the bottling partner. The subsequent sale of the finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third \\nparty does not impact the timing of recognizing the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume. When we account for an \\nunconsolidated bottling partner as an equity method investment, we eliminate the intercompany profit related to concentrate \\nsales to the extent of our ownership interest, until the equity method investee has sold finished products manufactured from the \\nconcentrates or syrups to a third party. We typically report unit case volume when finished products manufactured from the \\nconcentrates or syrups are sold to a third party, regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any.\\nWe generally refer to acquisitions and divestitures of bottling operations as “structural changes,” which are a component of \\nacquisitions and divestitures. Typically, structural changes do not impact the Company’s unit case volume or concentrate sales \\nvolume on a consolidated basis or at the geographic operating segment level. We recognize unit case volume for all sales of \\nCompany beverage products, regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any. However, the unit case volume \\nreported by our Bottling Investments operating segment is generally impacted by structural changes because it only includes the \\n42\\nunit case volume of our consolidated bottling operations. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for \\nadditional information on the Company’s acquisitions and divestitures. \\n“Acquired brands” refers to brands acquired during the past 12 months. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case \\nvolume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to acquired brands in periods prior to the closing of a transaction. \\nTherefore, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume related to an acquired brand are incremental to prior year volume. \\nWe generally do not consider the acquisition of a brand to be a structural change.\\n“Licensed brands” refers to brands not owned by the Company but for which we hold certain rights, generally including, but not \\nlimited to, distribution rights, and from which we derive an economic benefit when the related products are sold. Typically, the \\nCompany has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to a licensed brand in periods prior \\nto the beginning of the term of a license agreement. Therefore, in the year that a license agreement is entered into, the unit case \\nvolume and concentrate sales volume related to a licensed brand are incremental to prior year volume. We generally do not \\nconsider the licensing of a brand to be a structural change.\\nIn August 2022, the Company acquired a controlling interest in a bottling operation in Malawi. The impact of this acquisition \\nhas been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the \\nBottling Investments and Europe, Middle East and Africa operating segments. Additionally, the Company refranchised our \\nbottling operations in Cambodia and Vietnam in November 2022 and January 2023, respectively, the impact of which has been \\nincluded as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Bottling \\nInvestments and Asia Pacific operating segments.\\nIn May 2023 and July 2022, the Company acquired certain brands in Asia Pacific. The impact of acquiring these brands has \\nbeen included in acquisitions and divestitures in our analysis of net revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Asia \\nPacific operating segment.\\nBeverage Volume\\nWe measure the volume of Company beverage products sold in two ways: (1) unit cases of finished products and \\n(2) concentrate sales. As used in this report, “unit case” means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished \\nbeverage (24 eight-ounce servings), with the exception of unit case equivalents for Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, \\nwhich are primarily measured in number of transactions; and “unit case volume” means the number of unit cases (or unit case \\nequivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers or \\nconsumers. Unit case volume consists primarily of beverage products bearing Company trademarks. Also included in unit case \\nvolume are certain brands licensed to, or distributed by, our Company, and brands owned by Coca-Cola system bottlers for \\nwhich our Company provides marketing support and from the sale of which we derive an economic benefit. In addition, unit \\ncase volume includes sales by certain joint ventures in which the Company has an ownership interest. We believe unit case \\nvolume is one of the indicators of the underlying strength of the Coca-Cola system because it measures demand for our \\nproducts at the consumer level. The unit case volume numbers used in this report are derived based on estimates received by the \\nCompany from its bottling partners and distributors. Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, \\nsource waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished beverages \\nsold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. For Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, concentrate \\nsales volume represents the amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in \\nunit case equivalents), sold by the Company to customers or consumers. Unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth \\nrates are not necessarily equal during any given period. Factors such as seasonality, bottlers’ inventory practices, supply point \\nchanges, timing of price increases, new product introductions and changes in product mix can create differences between unit \\ncase volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates. In addition to these items, the impact of unit case volume from certain \\njoint ventures in which the Company has an ownership interest, but to which the Company does not sell concentrates, syrups, \\nsource waters or powders/minerals, may give rise to differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth \\nrates.\\n43\\nInformation about our volume growth worldwide and by operating segment is as follows:\\nPercent Change 2023 versus 2022\\nUnit Cases\\n1,2\\nConcentrate \\nSales\\nWorldwide\\n 2% \\n 2% \\nEurope, Middle East & Africa\\n (2) \\n — \\nLatin America\\n 5 \\n 6 \\nNorth America\\n (1) \\n (1) \\nAsia Pacific\\n 3 \\n — \\nGlobal Ventures\\n 4 \\n 5 \\nBottling Investments\\n (1) \\n3\\n         N/A\\n1 Bottling Investments operating segment data reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only.\\n2 Geographic and Global Ventures operating segment data reflect unit case volume growth for all bottlers, both consolidated and \\nunconsolidated, and distributors in the applicable geographic areas. Global Ventures operating segment data also reflects unit case volume \\ngrowth for Costa retail stores.\\n3 After considering the impact of structural changes, unit case volume for Bottling Investments grew 6%.\\nUnit Case Volume\\nThe Coca-Cola system sold 33.3 billion and 32.7 billion unit cases of our products in 2023 and 2022, respectively.\\nUnit case volume in Europe, Middle East and Africa decreased 2%, which included a 3% decline in sparkling flavors, a 14% \\ndecline in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages, a 1% decline in Trademark Coca-Cola, and a 2% decline in \\nwater, sports, coffee and tea. The operating segment reported declines in unit case volume of 6% in the Europe operating unit \\nand 1% in the Eurasia and Middle East operating unit, partially offset by growth in unit case volume of 3% in the Africa \\noperating unit. The decline in unit case volume in Europe, Middle East and Africa was primarily due to the suspension of the \\nCompany’s business in Russia in March 2022. \\nIn Latin America, unit case volume increased 5%, which included 5% growth in Trademark Coca-Cola, 9% growth in water, \\nsports, coffee and tea, 2% growth in sparkling flavors and 3% growth in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages. \\nThe operating segment’s volume performance included 5% growth in both Mexico and Brazil.\\nUnit case volume in North America decreased 1%, which included a 5% decline in water, sports, coffee and tea, partially offset \\nby 3% growth in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages and 1% growth in sparkling flavors. Trademark Coca-Cola \\nperformance was even.\\nIn Asia Pacific, unit case volume increased 3%, which included 4% growth in both sparkling flavors and Trademark Coca-Cola, \\n10% growth in juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages, and 1% growth in water, sports, coffee and tea. The \\noperating segment reported growth in unit case volume of 11% in the India and Southwest Asia operating unit, 2% in the \\nGreater China and Mongolia operating unit, and 1% in both the ASEAN and South Pacific and the Japan and South Korea \\noperating units.\\nUnit case volume for Global Ventures increased 4%, driven by growth in energy drinks, partially offset by a 1% decline in both \\nwater, sports, coffee and tea as well as juice, value-added dairy and plant-based beverages.\\nUnit case volume for Bottling Investments decreased 1%, which primarily reflects the impact of refranchising our bottling \\noperations in Vietnam and Cambodia, partially offset by growth in India and South Africa. \\nConcentrate Sales Volume\\nIn 2023, worldwide concentrate sales volume and unit case volume both grew 2% compared to 2022. The differences between \\nconcentrate sales volume and unit case volume growth rates for the operating segments were primarily due to the timing of \\nconcentrate shipments and the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in which the Company has an ownership \\ninterest, but to which the Company does not sell concentrates, syrups, source waters or powders/minerals.\\n44\\nNet Operating Revenues\\nNet operating revenues were $45,754 million in 2023, compared to $43,004 million in 2022, an increase of $2,750 million, or \\n6%. \\nThe following table illustrates, on a percentage basis, the estimated impact of the factors resulting in the increase (decrease) in \\nnet operating revenues on a consolidated basis and for each of our operating segments:\\nPercent Change 2023 versus 2022\\nVolume1\\nPrice, Product & \\nGeographic Mix\\nForeign Currency \\nExchange Rate \\nFluctuations\\nAcquisitions & \\nDivestitures2 \\nTotal\\nConsolidated\\n 2% \\n 10% \\n (4) %\\n (1) %\\n 6% \\nEurope, Middle East & Africa\\n — \\n 19 \\n (12) \\n — \\n 7 \\nLatin America\\n 6 \\n 16 \\n (3) \\n — \\n 19 \\nNorth America\\n (1) \\n 8 \\n — \\n — \\n 7 \\nAsia Pacific\\n — \\n 5 \\n (5) \\n 1 \\n — \\nGlobal Ventures\\n 5 \\n 2 \\n — \\n — \\n 8 \\nBottling Investments\\n 6 \\n 8 \\n (7) \\n (8) \\n — \\nNote: Certain rows may not add due to rounding.\\n1 Represents the percent change in net operating revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in concentrate sales volume for our \\ngeographic operating segments and our Global Ventures operating segment (expressed in unit case equivalents) after considering the impact \\nof acquisitions and divestitures, if any. For our Bottling Investments operating segment, this represents the percent change in net operating \\nrevenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume after considering the impact of structural changes, if any. Our Bottling \\nInvestments operating segment data reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only after considering the impact of structural \\nchanges, if any. Refer to the heading “Beverage Volume” above.\\n2 Includes structural changes, if any. Refer to the heading “Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and Newly Licensed Brands” above.\\nRefer to the heading “Beverage Volume” above for additional information related to changes in our unit case and concentrate \\nsales volumes.\\n“Price, product and geographic mix” refers to the change in net operating revenues caused by factors such as price changes, the \\nmix of products and packages sold, and the mix of channels and geographic territories where the sales occurred. The impact of \\nprice, product and geographic mix is calculated by subtracting the change in net operating revenues resulting from volume \\nincreases or decreases, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and acquisitions and divestitures from the total change \\nin net operating revenues. Management believes that providing investors with price, product and geographic mix enhances their \\nunderstanding about the combined impact that the following items had on the Company’s net operating revenues: (1) pricing \\nactions taken by the Company and, where applicable, our bottling partners; (2) changes in the mix of products and packages \\nsold; (3) changes in the mix of channels where products were sold; and (4) changes in the mix of geographic territories where \\nproducts were sold. Management uses this measure in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the \\nCompany’s performance. \\nPrice, product and geographic mix had a 10% favorable impact on our consolidated net operating revenues. Price, product and \\ngeographic mix was impacted by a variety of factors and events, including, but not limited to, the following:\\n• Europe, Middle East and Africa — favorable pricing initiatives, including inflationary pricing in Türkiye and Zimbabwe, \\npartially offset by unfavorable geographic mix;\\n• Latin America — favorable pricing initiatives, including inflationary pricing in Argentina, along with favorable channel \\nand product mix, partially offset by increased funding for promotional and marketing support;\\n• North America — favorable pricing initiatives and favorable channel, package and product mix;\\n• Asia Pacific — favorable pricing initiatives, partially offset by unfavorable geographic mix and increased funding for \\npromotional and marketing support;\\n• Global Ventures — favorable pricing initiatives and favorable channel mix, primarily due to the favorable performance \\nof Costa in the United Kingdom, offset by unfavorable product mix and the impact of no longer receiving COVID-\\nrelated incentives in the current year; and\\n• Bottling Investments — favorable pricing initiatives across most markets, partially offset by unfavorable geographic \\nmix.\\n45\\nThe favorable pricing initiatives for the year ended December 31, 2023 in all operating segments included carryover pricing \\nincreases from the prior year.\\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates decreased our consolidated net operating revenues by 4%. This unfavorable \\nimpact was primarily due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies, including the Argentine peso, \\nZimbabwean dollar, South African rand, Nigerian naira, Turkish lira, Japanese yen, Indian rupee and Chinese yuan, which had \\nan unfavorable impact on our Latin America; Europe, Middle East and Africa; Asia Pacific; and Bottling Investments operating \\nsegments. The unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to the currencies listed above was partially offset by the \\nimpact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the Mexican peso, which had a favorable \\nimpact on our Latin America operating segment. Refer to the heading “Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position — \\nForeign Exchange” below for additional information about the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\\n“Acquisitions and divestitures” generally refers to acquisitions and divestitures of brands or businesses, some of which the \\nCompany considers to be structural changes. The impact of acquisitions and divestitures is the difference between the change in \\nnet operating revenues and the change in what our net operating revenues would have been if we removed the net operating \\nrevenues associated with an acquisition or a divestiture from either the current year or the prior year, as applicable. \\nManagement believes that quantifying the impact that acquisitions and divestitures had on the Company’s net operating \\nrevenues provides investors with useful information to enhance their understanding of the Company’s net operating revenue \\nperformance by improving their ability to compare our year-to-year results. Management considers the impact of acquisitions \\nand divestitures when evaluating the Company’s performance. Refer to the heading “Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and \\nNewly Licensed Brands” above for additional information related to acquisitions and divestitures.\\nNet operating revenue growth rates are impacted by sales volume; price, product and geographic mix; foreign currency \\nexchange rate fluctuations; and acquisitions and divestitures. The size and timing of acquisitions and divestitures are not \\nconsistent from period to period. Based on current spot rates and our hedging coverage in place, we expect foreign currency \\nexchange rate fluctuations will have an unfavorable impact on our full year 2024 net operating revenues.\\nInformation about our net operating revenues by operating segment and Corporate as a percentage of Company net operating \\nrevenues is as follows:\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\nEurope, Middle East & Africa\\n 16.2% \\n 16.0% \\nLatin America\\n 12.7 \\n 11.4 \\nNorth America\\n 36.6 \\n 36.5 \\nAsia Pacific\\n 10.3 \\n 11.0 \\nGlobal Ventures\\n 6.7 \\n 6.6 \\nBottling Investments\\n 17.2 \\n 18.3 \\nCorporate\\n 0.3 \\n 0.2 \\nTotal\\n 100.0% \\n 100.0% \\nThe percentage contribution of each operating segment fluctuates over time due to net operating revenues in some operating \\nsegments growing at a faster rate compared to other operating segments. In addition, foreign currency exchange rate \\nfluctuations impact the percentage contribution of each operating segment. For additional information about the impact of \\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations, refer to the heading “Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position — \\nForeign Exchange” below. \\nGross Profit Margin\\nGross profit margin is a ratio calculated by dividing gross profit by net operating revenues. Management believes gross profit \\nmargin provides investors with useful information related to the profitability of our business prior to considering all of the \\nselling, general and administrative expenses and other operating charges incurred. Management uses this measure in making \\nfinancial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company’s performance. \\nOur gross profit margin increased to 59.5% in 2023 from 58.1% in 2022. This increase was primarily due to the impact of \\nfavorable pricing initiatives, favorable channel and package mix, and structural changes. The impact of these items was \\npartially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and increased commodity costs. \\n46\\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\\nThe following table sets forth the components of selling, general and administrative expenses (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\nSelling and distribution expenses\\n$ \\n2,599 $ \\n2,767 \\nAdvertising expenses\\n \\n5,010  \\n4,319 \\nStock-based compensation expense\\n \\n254  \\n356 \\nOther operating expenses\\n \\n6,109  \\n5,438 \\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\\n$ \\n13,972 $ \\n12,880 \\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $1,092 million, or 8%, in 2023. This increase was primarily due to \\nhigher advertising and other operating expenses, partially offset by decreases in selling and distribution expenses and stock-\\nbased compensation expense. The increase in other operating expenses was primarily due to higher other marketing expenses \\nand increased charitable donations, as well as higher annual incentive expense and other employee benefit costs. The decrease \\nin selling and distribution expenses was primarily a result of the refranchising of our bottling operations in Vietnam and \\nCambodia. The decrease in stock-based compensation expense was primarily due to the cumulative expense that was recorded \\nin 2022 resulting from the impact a more favorable financial outlook had on the outstanding nonvested performance share units. \\nIn 2023, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased selling, general and administrative expenses by 3%.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $267 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock-based \\ncompensation awards granted under our plans, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years as \\nstock-based compensation expense. This expected cost does not include the impact of any future stock-based compensation \\nawards.

In 2023, equity income was $1,691 million, compared to equity income of $1,472 million in 2022, an \\nincrease of $219 million, or 15%. The increase reflects, among other items, the impact of more favorable operating results \\nreported by some of our equity method investees in the current year and a favorable foreign currency exchange rate impact. \\nThese favorable impacts were partially offset by a $125 million increase in net charges resulting from the Company’s \\nproportionate share of significant operating and nonoperating items recorded by certain of our equity method investees.\\nOther Income (Loss) — Net\\nIn 2023, other income (loss) — net was income of $570 million.

Refer to Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for \\nthe impact these items had on our operating segments and Corporate.\\nIncome Taxes\\nOur effective tax rate reflects the tax benefits of having significant operations outside the United States, which are generally \\ntaxed at rates lower than the statutory U.S. federal tax rate. As a result of employment actions and capital investments made by \\nthe Company, certain tax jurisdictions provide income tax incentive grants, including Brazil, Costa Rica, Singapore and \\nEswatini. The terms of these grants expire from 2025 to 2036. We anticipate that we will be able to extend or renew the grants \\nin these locations. Tax incentive grants favorably impacted our income tax expense by $332 million and $406 million for the \\nyears ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In addition, our effective tax rate reflects the benefits of having \\nsignificant earnings generated in investments accounted for under the equity method. \\nA reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal tax rate and our effective tax rate is as follows:\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\nStatutory U.S. federal tax rate\\n 21.0% \\n 21.0% \\nState and local income taxes — net of federal benefit\\n 1.1 \\n 1.4 \\nEarnings in jurisdictions taxed at rates different from the statutory U.S. federal tax rate\\n (0.3) \\n (0.6) \\nEquity income or loss\\n (2.1) \\n (2.7) \\nExcess tax benefits on stock-based compensation\\n (0.3) \\n (0.7) \\nOther — net\\n (2.0) \\n (0.3) \\nEffective tax rate\\n 17.4% \\n 18.1% \\nOn November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued the Opinion regarding the Company’s 2015 litigation with the IRS involving \\ntransfer pricing tax adjustments in which the court predominantly sided with the IRS. On November 8, 2023, the Tax Court \\nissued a supplemental opinion, siding with the IRS in concluding both that the blocked-income regulations apply to the \\nCompany’s operations and that the Tax Court opinion in 3M Co. & Subs. v. Commissioner (February 9, 2023) controlled as to \\nthe validity of those regulations. The Company strongly disagrees with the Opinions and intends to vigorously defend its \\nposition. Refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $929 million. If the Company were to prevail on \\nall uncertain tax positions, the net effect would be a benefit of $632 million, exclusive of any benefits related to interest and \\npenalties. The remaining $297 million primarily represents tax benefits that would be received in different tax jurisdictions in \\nthe event the Company did not prevail on all uncertain tax positions.\\n50\\nA reconciliation of the changes in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\nBalance of unrecognized tax benefits at beginning of year\\n$ \\n926 $ \\n906 \\nIncrease related to prior period tax positions\\n \\n2  \\n6 \\nDecrease related to prior period tax positions\\n \\n(25)  \\n— \\nIncrease related to current period tax positions\\n \\n32  \\n38 \\nDecrease related to settlements with taxing authorities\\n \\n—  \\n(2) \\nDecrease due to lapse of the applicable statute of limitations\\n \\n(2)  \\n— \\nEffect of foreign currency translation\\n \\n(4)  \\n(22) \\nBalance of unrecognized tax benefits at end of year\\n$ \\n929 $ \\n926 \\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the line item income taxes in our \\nconsolidated statement of income. The Company had $544 million and $496 million in interest and penalties related to \\nunrecognized tax benefits accrued as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Of these amounts, expense of $48 million \\nand $43 million was recognized in 2023 and 2022, respectively. If the Company were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, \\nthe reversal of this accrual would be a benefit to the Company’s effective tax rate.\\nBased on current tax laws, the Company’s effective tax rate in 2024 is expected to be approximately 19.2% before considering \\nthe potential impact of any significant operating and nonoperating items that may affect our effective tax rate. This rate does not \\ninclude the impact of the ongoing tax litigation with the IRS, if the Company were not to prevail.\\nMany jurisdictions have enacted legislation and adopted policies resulting from the OECD’s Anti-Base Erosion and Profit \\nShifting project. The OECD is currently coordinating a two pillared project on behalf of the G20 and other participating \\ncountries which would grant additional taxing rights over profits earned by multinational enterprises to the countries in which \\ntheir products are sold and services rendered. Pillar One would allow countries to reallocate a portion of profits earned by \\nmultinational businesses with an annual global revenue exceeding €20 billion and a profit margin of over 10% to applicable \\nmarket jurisdictions. While the OECD issued draft language for the international implementation of Pillar One in October 2023, \\nboth the substantive rules and implementation process remain under discussion at the OECD so the timetable for any \\nimplementation remains uncertain. \\nIn December 2021, the OECD issued Pillar Two model rules which would establish a global per-country minimum tax of 15%, \\nand the European Union has approved a directive requiring member states to incorporate similar provisions into their respective \\ndomestic laws. The directive requires the rules to initially become effective for fiscal years starting on or after December 31, \\n2023. While it is uncertain whether the United States will enact legislation to adopt Pillar Two, numerous countries have \\nenacted legislation, or have indicated their intent to adopt legislation, to implement certain aspects of Pillar Two effective \\nJanuary 1, 2024, with general implementation of the remaining global minimum tax rules by January 1, 2025. The OECD and \\nimplementing countries are expected to continue to make further revisions to their legislation and release additional guidance. \\nThe Company will continue to monitor developments to determine any potential impact in the countries in which we operate.\\nLIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND FINANCIAL POSITION\\nWe believe our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities is one of the fundamental strengths of our business. \\nRefer to the heading “Cash Flows from Operating Activities” below. The Company does not typically raise capital through the \\nissuance of stock. Instead, we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital and increase our return on shareowners’ \\nequity. Refer to the heading “Cash Flows from Financing Activities” below. We have a history of borrowing funds both \\ndomestically and internationally at reasonable interest rates, and we expect to be able to continue to borrow funds at reasonable \\nrates over the long term. Our debt financing also includes the use of a commercial paper program. We currently have the ability \\nto borrow funds in this market at levels that are consistent with our debt financing strategy, and we expect to continue to be able \\nto do so in the future. The Company regularly reviews its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt. \\nThe Company’s cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and marketable securities totaled $13.7 billion as of \\nDecember 31, 2023. In addition to these funds, our commercial paper program and our ability to issue long-term debt, we had \\n$4.6 billion in unused backup lines of credit for general corporate purposes as of December 31, 2023. These backup lines of \\ncredit expire at various times through 2028.\\n51\\nOur current payment terms with the majority of our suppliers are 120 days. Two global financial institutions offer a voluntary \\nsupply chain finance program which enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from the Company to \\nthese financial institutions on a non-recourse basis at a rate that leverages our credit rating and thus may be more beneficial to \\nthem. We do not believe there is a risk that our payment terms will be shortened in the near future. Refer to Note 9 of Notes to \\nConsolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\\nThe Company has a trade accounts receivable factoring program in certain countries. Under this program, we can elect to sell \\ntrade accounts receivables to unaffiliated financial institutions at a discount. In these factoring arrangements, for ease of \\nadministration, the Company collects customer payments related to the factored receivables and remits those payments to the \\nfinancial institutions. The Company sold $17,704 million and $10,709 million of trade accounts receivables under this program \\nduring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The costs of factoring such receivables were $83 million and \\n$27 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The cash received from the financial institutions is \\nclassified within the operating activities section in our consolidated statement of cash flows.\\nOur current capital allocation priorities are as follows: investing wisely to support our business operations, continuing to grow \\nour dividend payment, enhancing our beverage portfolio and capabilities through consumer-centric acquisitions, and using \\nexcess cash to repurchase shares over time. We currently expect 2024 capital expenditures to be approximately $2.2 billion. \\nDuring 2024, we also expect to repurchase shares to offset dilution resulting from employee stock-based compensation plans.\\nWe are currently in litigation with the IRS for tax years 2007 through 2009. On November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued the \\nOpinion in which it predominantly sided with the IRS. On November 8, 2023, the Tax Court issued a supplemental opinion, \\nsiding with the IRS in concluding both that the blocked-income regulations apply to the Company’s operations and that the Tax \\nCourt opinion in 3M Co. & Subs. v. Commissioner (February 9, 2023) controlled as to the validity of those regulations. The \\nCompany strongly disagrees with the IRS’ positions and the portions of the Opinions affirming such positions and intends to \\nvigorously defend our positions utilizing every available avenue of appeal. While the Company believes that it is more likely \\nthan not that we will ultimately prevail in this litigation upon appeal, it is possible that all, or some portion of, the adjustments \\nproposed by the IRS and sustained by the Tax Court could ultimately be upheld. In the event that all of the adjustments \\nproposed by the IRS were to be ultimately upheld for tax years 2007 through 2009 and the IRS, with the consent of the federal \\ncourts, were to decide to apply the Tax Court Methodology to the subsequent years up to and including 2023, the Company \\ncurrently estimates that the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability could be approximately $16 billion as of \\nDecember 31, 2023. Additional income tax and interest would continue to accrue until the time any such potential liability, or \\nportion thereof, were to be paid. The Company and the IRS are now in the process of agreeing on the tax impacts of the \\nOpinions. Subsequent to the completion of this process, the Tax Court will render a decision in the case. The Company will \\nhave 90 days thereafter to file a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. The IRS can then seek to \\ncollect, and the Company expects to pay, any additional tax related to the 2007 through 2009 tax years reflected in the Tax \\nCourt decision (and interest thereon). The Company currently estimates that the payment to be made at that time related to the \\n2007 through 2009 tax years, which is included in the above estimate of the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest \\nliability, would be approximately $5.8 billion (including interest accrued through December 31, 2023), plus any additional \\ninterest accrued through the time of payment. Some or all of this amount, plus accrued interest, would be refunded if the \\nCompany were to prevail on appeal. Refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information \\non the tax litigation.\\nWhile we believe it is more likely than not that we will prevail in the tax litigation discussed above, we are confident that, \\nbetween our ability to generate cash flows from operating activities and our ability to borrow funds at reasonable interest rates, \\nwe can manage the range of possible outcomes in the final resolution of the matter.\\nBased on all of the aforementioned factors, the Company believes its current liquidity position is strong and will continue to be \\nsufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities for the foreseeable future.\\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $11,599 million and \\n$11,018 million, respectively, an increase of $581 million, or 5%. This increase was primarily driven by strong operating \\nresults and lower marketing payments resulting from year-end accruals. These items were partially offset by an unfavorable \\nimpact due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, higher interest and tax payments in the current year, the unfavorable \\nimpact from the extension of certain vendor payment terms in the prior year, payments resulting from the buildup of inventory \\nin the prior year to manage potential supply chain disruptions, payments related to our restructuring initiatives and $167 million \\nof the $275 million milestone payment for fairlife. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for \\nadditional information on the milestone payment for fairlife.\\n52\\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\\nNet cash used in investing activities was $3,349 million and $763 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively.\\nPurchases of Investments and Proceeds from Disposals of Investments\\nIn 2023, purchases of investments were $6,698 million and proceeds from disposals of investments were $4,354 million, \\nresulting in a net cash outflow of $2,344 million. In 2022, purchases of investments were $3,751 million and proceeds from \\ndisposals of investments were $4,771 million, resulting in a net cash inflow of $1,020 million. This activity primarily represents \\nthe purchases of, and proceeds from the disposals of, investments in marketable securities and short-term investments that were \\nmade as part of the Company’s overall cash management strategy. Also included in this activity are purchases of, and proceeds \\nfrom the disposals of, investments held by our captive insurance companies.\\nAcquisitions of Businesses, Equity Method Investments and Nonmarketable Securities\\nIn 2023 and 2022, the Company’s acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled \\n$62 million and $73 million, respectively.\\nProceeds from Disposals of Businesses, Equity Method Investments and Nonmarketable Securities\\nIn 2023 and 2022, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled \\n$430 million and $458 million, respectively. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional \\ninformation.\\nPurchases of Property, Plant and Equipment\\nPurchases of property, plant and equipment during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $1,852 million and \\n$1,484 million, respectively.\\nTotal capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and the percentage of such totals by operating segment and \\nCorporate were as follows (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\nCapital expenditures\\n$ \\n1,852 \\n$ \\n1,484 \\nEurope, Middle East & Africa\\n 2.3% \\n 3.3% \\nLatin America\\n — \\n 0.3 \\nNorth America\\n 22.3 \\n 18.9 \\nAsia Pacific\\n 1.2 \\n 1.5 \\nGlobal Ventures\\n 10.4 \\n 12.0 \\nBottling Investments\\n 45.5 \\n 47.0 \\nCorporate\\n 18.3 \\n 17.0 \\nCollateral (Paid) Received Associated with Hedging Activities — Net\\nCollateral received associated with our hedging activities during the year ended December 31, 2023 was $366 million and \\ncollateral paid associated with our hedging activities during the year ended December 31, 2022 was $1,465 million. Refer to \\nNote 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our hedging activities. \\nOther Investing Activities\\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the total cash inflow for other investing activities was $39 million and \\n$706 million, respectively. The activities during 2022 included cash proceeds of $823 million received in advance of the \\nrefranchising of our bottling operations in Vietnam. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for \\nadditional information on this transaction. \\n53\\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\\nNet cash used in financing activities was $8,310 million and $10,250 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively.\\nLoans, Notes Payable and Long-Term Debt\\nOur Company maintains debt levels we consider prudent based on our cash flows, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt \\nto capital. We use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital, which increases our return on shareowners’ equity. This \\nexposes us to adverse changes in interest rates. Our interest expense may also be affected by our credit ratings.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, our long-term debt was rated “A+” by Standard & Poor’s and “A1” by Moody’s. Our commercial \\npaper program was rated “A-1” by Standard & Poor’s and “P-1” by Moody’s. In assessing our credit strength, both rating \\nagencies consider our capital structure (including the amount and maturity dates of our debt) and financial policies as well as \\nthe consolidated balance sheet and other financial information of the Company. In addition, certain rating agencies also \\nconsider the financial information of certain bottlers, including CCEP, Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc., Coca-Cola FEMSA and \\nCoca-Cola Hellenic. While the Company has no legal obligation for the debt of these bottlers, the rating agencies believe the \\nstrategic importance of the bottlers to the Company’s business model provides the Company with an incentive to keep these \\nbottlers viable. It is our expectation that these rating agencies will continue using this methodology. If our credit ratings were to \\nbe downgraded as a result of changes in our capital structure, our major bottlers’ financial performance, changes in the credit \\nrating agencies’ methodology in assessing our credit strength, or for any other reason, our cost of borrowing could increase. \\nAdditionally, if certain bottlers’ credit ratings were to decline, the Company’s equity income could be reduced as a result of the \\npotential increase in interest expense for those bottlers.\\nWe monitor our financial ratios and, as indicated above, the rating agencies consider these ratios in assessing our credit ratings. \\nEach rating agency employs a different aggregation methodology and has different thresholds for the various financial ratios. \\nThese thresholds are not necessarily permanent, nor are they always fully disclosed to our Company.\\nOur global presence and strong capital position give us access to key financial markets around the world, enabling us to borrow \\nfunds at a low effective cost. This posture, coupled with active management of our mix of short-term and long-term debt as well \\nas our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, results in a lower overall cost of borrowing. Our debt management policies, in \\nconjunction with our share repurchase program and investment activity, can result in current liabilities exceeding current assets.\\nDuring 2023, the Company had issuances of debt of $6,891 million, which included $6,436 million of issuances of commercial \\npaper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days, $222 million of net issuances of commercial paper and short-\\nterm debt with maturities of 90 days or less, and long-term debt issuances of $233 million, net of related discounts and issuance \\ncosts.\\nDuring 2023, the Company made payments of debt of $5,034 million, which consisted of $4,591 million of payments related to \\ncommercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days and payments of long-term debt of $443 million.\\nDuring 2022, the Company had issuances of debt of $3,972 million, which included $2,321 million of issuances of commercial \\npaper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days, $798 million of net issuances of commercial paper and short-\\nterm debt with maturities of 90 days or less, and long-term debt issuances of $853 million, net of related discounts and issuance \\ncosts.\\nDuring 2022, the Company made payments of debt of $4,930 million, which consisted of $3,623 million of payments related to \\ncommercial paper and short-term debt with maturities greater than 90 days and payments of long-term debt of $1,307 million. \\nOn December 31, 2021, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, the governing body responsible for regulating \\nLIBOR, ceased to publish certain LIBOR reference rates. However, other LIBOR reference rates, including U.S. dollar \\novernight, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and 12-month maturities, continued to be published through June 2023. As a result of \\nthe discontinuation of LIBOR, we have amended our LIBOR-referencing agreements to either reference the Secured Overnight \\nFinancing Rate or include mechanics for selecting an alternative rate. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial \\nStatements for additional information on our hedging activities.\\nIssuances of Stock\\nThe issuances of stock in 2023 and 2022 were related to the exercise of stock options by employees.\\nPurchases of Stock for Treasury \\nIn 2012, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase plan of up to 500 million shares (“2012 Plan”) of the Company’s \\ncommon stock. In May 2022, the Company reached the maximum number of shares that could be repurchased under the 2012 \\nPlan and thereby completed the plan. In 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase plan of up to \\n150 million shares (“2019 Plan”) of the Company’s common stock. \\n54\\nDuring 2023, the total cash outflow for treasury stock purchases was $2,289 million. The Company repurchased 36.9 million \\nshares of common stock under the 2019 Plan authorized by our Board of Directors. These shares were repurchased at an \\naverage price per share of $59.08, for a total cost of $2,177 million. The net impact of the Company’s issuances of stock and \\ntreasury stock purchases during 2023 resulted in a net cash outflow of $1,750 million. \\nDuring 2022, the total cash outflow for treasury stock purchases was $1,418 million. The Company repurchased 21.3 million \\nshares of common stock under the share repurchase plans authorized by our Board of Directors. These shares were repurchased \\nat an average price per share of $62.67, for a total cost of $1,336 million. The net impact of the Company’s issuances of stock \\nand treasury stock purchases during 2022 resulted in a net cash outflow of $581 million. \\nSince the inception of our share repurchase program in 1984, we have repurchased 3.6 billion shares of our common stock at an \\naverage price per share of $17.96. In addition to shares repurchased under the share repurchase plans authorized by our Board \\nof Directors, the Company’s treasury stock activity also includes shares surrendered to the Company to pay the exercise price \\nand/or to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with so-called stock swap exercises of employee stock options and/\\nor the vesting of restricted stock issued to employees.\\nDividends\\nThe Company paid dividends of $7,952 million and $7,616 million during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, \\nrespectively. \\nAt its February 2024 meeting, our Board of Directors increased our regular quarterly dividend to $0.485 per share, equivalent to \\na full year dividend of $1.94 per share in 2024. This is our 62nd consecutive annual increase. Our annualized common stock \\ndividend was $1.84 per share and $1.76 per share in 2023 and 2022, respectively. \\nOther Financing Activities\\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the total cash outflow for other financing activities was $465 million and \\n$1,095 million, respectively. The activities during 2023 included $108 million of the $275 million milestone payment for \\nfairlife. The activities during 2023 and 2022 also included payments totaling $311 million and $637 million, respectively, \\nrelated to the BodyArmor acquisition, which included amounts originally held back for indemnification obligations. \\nAdditionally, other financing activities during 2022 included repayments of collateral related to our hedging programs of \\n$403 million. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the milestone \\npayment for fairlife.\\n55\\nContractual Obligations\\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company’s contractual obligations, including payments due by period, were as follows (in \\nmillions):\\nPayments Due by Period\\nTotal\\n2024\\n2025-2026\\n2027-2028\\n2029 and\\nThereafter\\nLoans and notes payable:1\\n \\n \\n  \\nCommercial paper borrowings\\n$ \\n4,209 $ \\n4,209 $ \\n— $ \\n— $ \\n— \\nLines of credit and other short-term borrowings\\n \\n348  \\n348  \\n—  \\n—  \\n— \\nCurrent maturities of long-term debt2\\n \\n1,960  \\n1,960  \\n—  \\n—  \\n— \\nLong-term debt, net of current maturities2\\n \\n36,694  \\n—  \\n2,936  \\n7,579  \\n26,179 \\nEstimated interest payments3\\n \\n9,855  \\n878  \\n1,120  \\n909  \\n6,948 \\nAccrued income taxes4\\n \\n2,649  \\n1,569  \\n1,080  \\n—  \\n— \\nPurchase obligations5\\n \\n23,392  \\n13,701  \\n3,330  \\n2,057  \\n4,304 \\nMarketing obligations6\\n \\n4,076  \\n2,563  \\n756  \\n403  \\n354 \\nLease obligations\\n \\n2,007  \\n444  \\n562  \\n363  \\n638 \\nAcquisition obligations7\\n \\n3,030  \\n13  \\n3,017  \\n—  \\n— \\nHeld-for-sale and related obligations8\\n \\n903  \\n809  \\n64  \\n21  \\n9 \\nTotal contractual obligations\\n$ \\n89,123 $ \\n26,494 $ \\n12,865 $ \\n11,332 $ \\n38,432 \\n1 Refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding loans and notes payable. Upon payment \\nof outstanding commercial paper, we typically issue new commercial paper. Lines of credit and other short-term borrowings are expected to \\nfluctuate depending upon current liquidity needs, especially at international subsidiaries.\\n2 Refer to Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding long-term debt. We will consider \\nseveral alternatives for settling this long-term debt, including the use of cash flows from operating activities, issuance of commercial paper \\nor issuance of other long-term debt. The table above shows expected cash payments to be made by the Company and excludes the noncash \\nportion of debt, including any fair value adjustments, unamortized discounts and premiums.\\n3 We calculated estimated interest payments for our long-term debt based on the applicable rates and payment dates. For our variable-rate \\ndebt, we have assumed the December 31, 2023 rate for all periods presented. We expect to fund such interest payments with cash flows from \\noperating activities and/or short-term borrowings.\\n4 Refer to Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding income taxes. Accrued income taxes \\ninclude $2,029 million related to the one-time transition tax required by the Tax Reform Act. Liabilities of $1,476 million for unrecognized \\ntax benefits plus accrued interest and penalties are not included in the total above. Currently, the settlement period for the unrecognized tax \\nbenefits cannot be determined. In addition, any payments related to unrecognized tax benefits may be partially or fully offset by reductions \\nin payments in other jurisdictions.\\n5 Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all \\nsignificant terms. These agreements include long-term contractual obligations, open purchase orders, accounts payable and certain accrued \\nliabilities. We expect to fund these purchase obligations with cash flows from operating activities. \\n6 We expect to fund these marketing obligations with cash flows from operating activities.\\n7 Primarily represents our contingent consideration liability related to our acquisition of fairlife. Refer to Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements.\\n8 Represents liabilities and contractual obligations that were classified as held for sale related to the Company’s bottling operations in the \\nPhilippines and Bangladesh and certain bottling operations in India. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for \\nadditional information.\\nThe total accrued liability for pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized as of December 31, 2023 was \\n$948 million. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This amount is impacted by, among other items, \\nnet periodic benefit cost or income, plan funding levels, plan amendments, changes in plan demographics and assumptions, and \\nthe investment return on plan assets. Because the accrued liability does not represent expected liquidity needs, we did not \\ninclude this amount in the table above.\\nWe expect to make all contributions to our pension trusts with cash flows from operating activities. Our pension plans are \\ngenerally funded in accordance with local laws and tax regulations. The Company expects to contribute approximately \\n$47 million in 2024 to our pension trusts, all of which will be allocated to our international plans. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to \\nConsolidated Financial Statements. We did not include our estimated contributions to our pension trusts in the table above.\\n56\\nAs of December 31, 2023, the projected benefit obligation of the U.S. qualified pension plan was $4,094 million, and the fair \\nvalue of the plan assets was $4,056 million. The projected benefit obligation of all pension plans other than the U.S. qualified \\npension plan was $2,450 million, and the fair value of the plans’ assets was $3,204 million. The Company sponsors various \\nunfunded pension plans outside the United States as well as unfunded nonqualified pension plans covering certain U.S. \\nemployees. These U.S. nonqualified pension plans provide benefits that are not permitted to be funded through a qualified plan \\nbecause of limits imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. The expected benefit payments for these unfunded pension \\nplans are not included in the table above. However, we anticipate benefit payments for these unfunded pension plans will be \\napproximately $64 million annually for 2024 and 2025. Thereafter, the expected annual benefit payments will gradually \\ndecline. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\\nIn general, we are self-insured for large portions of many different types of claims; however, we do use commercial insurance \\nabove our self-insured retentions to reduce the Company’s risk of catastrophic loss. Our reserves for the Company’s self-\\ninsured losses are estimated using actuarial methods and assumptions of the insurance industry, adjusted for our specific \\nexpectations based on our claims history. As of December 31, 2023, our self-insurance reserves totaled $197 million. Refer to \\nNote 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We did not include estimated payments related to our self-insurance \\nreserves in the table above.\\nDeferred income tax liabilities as of December 31, 2023 were $2,639 million. Refer to Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements. This amount is not included in the table above because we believe that presentation would not be \\nmeaningful. Deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and \\nliabilities and their respective book bases, which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the underlying assets or \\nliabilities are settled at their reported financial statement amounts. The results of these calculations do not have a direct \\nconnection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future years. As a result, scheduling deferred income tax liabilities \\nas payments due by period could be misleading, because this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we were contingently liable for guarantees of indebtedness owed by third parties of $633 million, of \\nwhich $87 million was related to VIEs. Our guarantees are primarily related to third-party customers, bottlers and vendors and \\narose through the normal course of business. These guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees is individually \\nsignificant. These amounts represent the maximum potential future payments that we could be required to make under the \\nguarantees. However, management has concluded that the likelihood of any significant amounts being paid by our Company \\nunder these guarantees is remote. As of December 31, 2023, we were not directly liable for the debt of any unconsolidated \\nentity.\\nForeign Exchange\\nOur international operations are subject to certain opportunities and risks, including currency fluctuations and governmental \\nactions. We closely monitor our operations in each country and seek to adopt appropriate strategies that are responsive to \\nchanging economic and political environments as well as to fluctuations in currencies. Due to the geographic diversity of our \\noperations, weakness in some currencies may be offset by strength in other currencies over time.\\nIn 2023 and 2022, the weighted-average exchange rates for foreign currencies in which the Company conducted operations (all \\noperating currencies), and for certain individual currencies, strengthened (weakened) against the U.S. dollar as follows:\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\nAll operating currencies\\n (2) %\\n (8) %\\nAustralian dollar\\n (5) \\n (7) \\nBrazilian real\\n 3 \\n 4 \\nBritish pound\\n 2 \\n (11) \\nChinese yuan\\n (7) \\n (3) \\nEuro\\n 3 \\n (11) \\nIndian rupee\\n (6) \\n (5) \\nJapanese yen\\n (7) \\n (17) \\nMexican peso\\n 14 \\n 1 \\nPhilippine peso\\n (3) \\n (9) \\nSouth African rand\\n (11) \\n (9) \\n57\\nThe percentages in the table above do not include the effects of our hedging activities and, therefore, do not reflect the actual \\nimpact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our operating results. Our hedging activities are designed to \\nmitigate, over time, a portion of the potentially unfavorable impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our net income.\\nThe total impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on net operating revenues, including the effect of our hedging \\nactivities, was a decrease of 4% and 7% in 2023 and 2022, respectively. The total impact of foreign currency exchange rate \\nfluctuations on income before income taxes, including the effect of our hedging activities, was a decrease of 8% and 6% in \\n2023 and 2022, respectively.\\nForeign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily the result of the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities \\nfrom certain currencies into functional currencies. The effects of the remeasurement of these assets and liabilities are partially \\noffset by the impact of our economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note 5 \\nof Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses are recorded in the line item other \\nincome (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income. Refer to the heading “Operations Review — Other Income \\n(Loss) — Net” above. The Company recorded net foreign currency exchange losses of $312 million and $236 million during \\nthe years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\\nInflation affects the way we operate in many markets around the world. In general, we believe that, over time, we will be able to \\nincrease prices to counteract the majority of the inflationary effects of increasing costs and to generate sufficient cash flows to \\nmaintain our productive capability.\\nITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\\nOur Company uses derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency \\nexchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and other market risks. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments \\nfor trading purposes. As a matter of policy, all of our derivative positions are used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying \\neconomic exposure. Because of the high correlation between the hedging instruments and the underlying exposures, \\nfluctuations in the values of the instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the values of the underlying \\nexposures. \\nWe monitor our exposure to market risks using several objective measurement systems, including a sensitivity analysis to \\nmeasure our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Refer to Note 5 \\nof Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our hedging transactions and derivative \\nfinancial instruments.\\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates\\nWe manage most of our foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows us to net certain exposures and take \\nadvantage of any natural offsets. In 2023, we generated $29.2 billion of our net operating revenues from operations outside the \\nUnited States. Due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weakness in some currencies may be offset by strength in \\nother currencies over time. We use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency \\nexchange rate fluctuations.\\nOur Company enters into forward exchange contracts and purchases foreign currency options and collars (principally euro, \\nBritish pound and Japanese yen) to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. \\nAdditionally, we enter into forward exchange contracts to offset the earnings impact related to foreign currency exchange rate \\nfluctuations on certain monetary assets and liabilities. We also enter into forward exchange contracts as hedges of net \\ninvestments in foreign operations.\\nThe total notional values of our foreign currency derivatives were $17,505 million and $11,370 million as of December 31, \\n2023 and 2022, respectively. These values included derivative instruments that were designated and qualified for hedge \\naccounting along with derivative instruments that are economic hedges. The fair value of foreign currency derivatives that \\nqualified for hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized gain of $22 million as of December 31, 2023, and we estimate that a \\n10% weakening of the U.S. dollar would have resulted in a $278 million decrease in fair value. The fair value of the foreign \\ncurrency derivatives that did not qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized loss of $15 million as of \\nDecember 31, 2023, and we estimate that a 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar would have resulted in a $161 million decrease in \\nfair value.\\n58\\nInterest Rates\\nThe Company is subject to interest rate volatility with regard to existing and future issuances of debt. We monitor our mix of \\nfixed-rate and variable-rate debt as well as our mix of short-term debt and long-term debt. From time to time, we enter into \\ninterest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations.\\nBased on the Company’s variable-rate debt and derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2023, we estimate that a \\n1 percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by $134 million in 2023. However, this \\nincrease in interest expense would have been partially offset by the increase in interest income due to higher interest rates.\\nThe Company is subject to interest rate risk related to its investments in highly liquid debt securities. These investments are \\nprimarily managed by external managers within the guidelines of the Company’s investment policy. Our policy requires these \\ninvestments to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the risk of principal loss. In addition, our policy \\nlimits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. We estimate that a 1 percentage point increase in interest rates would \\nhave resulted in a $29 million decrease in the fair value of our portfolio of highly liquid debt securities.\\nCommodity Prices\\nThe Company is subject to market risk with respect to commodity price fluctuations, principally related to our purchases of \\nsweeteners, metals, juices, PET and fuels. We manage our exposure to commodity risks primarily through the use of supplier \\npricing agreements, which enable us to establish the purchase prices for certain inputs that are used in our manufacturing and \\ndistribution operations. When deemed appropriate, we use derivative financial instruments to further manage our exposure to \\ncommodity risks. Certain of these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, but they are effective economic hedges that \\nhelp the Company mitigate the price risk associated with the purchases and transportation of materials used in our \\nmanufacturing processes.\\nThe total notional values of our commodity derivatives were $379 million and $371 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, \\nrespectively. These values included derivative instruments that were designated and qualified for hedge accounting along with \\nderivative instruments that are economic hedges. The fair value of commodity derivatives that qualified for hedge accounting \\nresulted in a net unrealized loss of $3 million as of December 31, 2023, and we estimate that a 10% decrease in underlying \\ncommodity prices would have resulted in a $3 million decrease in fair value. The fair value of the commodity derivatives that \\ndid not qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a net loss of $58 million as of December 31, 2023, and we estimate that a 10% \\ndecrease in underlying commodity prices would have resulted in a $54 million decrease in fair value.\\n59\\nITEM 8.

1: BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES \\nWhen used in these notes, the terms “The Coca-Cola Company,” “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” mean The Coca-Cola \\nCompany and all entities included in our consolidated financial statements.\\nDescription of Business\\nThe Coca-Cola Company is a total beverage company. We own or license and market numerous beverage brands, which we \\ngroup into the following categories: Trademark Coca-Cola; sparkling flavors; water, sports, coffee and tea; juice, value-added \\ndairy and plant-based beverages; and emerging beverages. We own and market several of the world’s largest nonalcoholic \\nsparkling soft drink brands, including Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fanta, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and Diet Coke/Coca-Cola Light. \\nFinished beverage products bearing our trademarks, sold in the United States since 1886, are now sold in more than 200 \\ncountries and territories.\\nWe make our branded beverage products available to consumers throughout the world through our network of independent \\nbottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and retailers as well as the Company’s consolidated bottling and distribution \\noperations. Beverages bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to us account for 2.2 billion of the estimated 64 billion servings \\nof all beverages consumed worldwide every day.\\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nBasis of Presentation\\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally \\naccepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make \\nestimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of \\ncontingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Although these estimates are \\nbased on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately differ from \\nthese estimates and assumptions. Furthermore, when testing assets for impairment in future periods, if management uses \\ndifferent assumptions or if different conditions occur, impairment charges may result.\\nPrinciples of Consolidation\\nOur Company consolidates all entities that we control by ownership of a majority voting interest. Additionally, there are \\nsituations in which consolidation is required even though the usual condition of consolidation (i.e., ownership of a majority \\nvoting interest) does not apply. Generally, this occurs when an entity holds an interest in another business enterprise that was \\nachieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests, which results in a disproportionate relationship between \\nsuch entity’s voting interests in, and its exposure to the economic risks and potential rewards of, the other business enterprise. \\nThis disproportionate relationship results in what is known as a variable interest, and the entity in which another entity holds a \\nvariable interest is referred to as a “VIE.” An enterprise must consolidate a VIE if it is determined to be the primary beneficiary \\nof the VIE. The primary beneficiary has both (1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the \\nentity’s economic performance and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could \\npotentially be significant to the VIE.\\nOur Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling operations, for which we were not determined to be the \\nprimary beneficiary. Our variable interests in these VIEs primarily relate to equity investments, profit guarantees or \\nsubordinated financial support. Refer to Note 12. Although these financial arrangements resulted in our holding variable \\ninterests in these entities, they did not empower us to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs’ \\neconomic performance. Our Company’s investments, plus any loans and guarantees, and other subordinated financial support \\nrelated to these VIEs totaled $1,225 million and $1,626 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, representing \\nour maximum exposures to loss. The Company’s investments, plus any loans and guarantees, related to these VIEs were not \\nindividually significant to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\\nIn addition, our Company holds interests in certain VIEs, primarily bottling operations, for which we were determined to be the \\nprimary beneficiary. As a result, we have consolidated these entities. Our Company’s investments, plus any loans and \\nguarantees, related to these VIEs totaled $88 million and $109 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, \\nrepresenting our maximum exposures to loss. The assets and liabilities of VIEs for which we are the primary beneficiary were \\nnot significant to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\\nCreditors of our VIEs do not have recourse against the general credit of the Company, regardless of whether the VIEs are \\naccounted for as consolidated entities.\\n66\\nWe use the equity method to account for investments in companies if our investment provides us with the ability to exercise \\nsignificant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee. Our consolidated net income includes our \\nCompany’s proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies. Our judgment regarding the level of influence \\nover each equity method investee includes considering key factors, such as our ownership interest, representation on the board \\nof directors, participation in policy-making decisions, other commercial arrangements and material intercompany transactions.\\nWe eliminate from our financial results all significant intercompany transactions, including the intercompany transactions with \\nconsolidated VIEs and the intercompany portion of transactions with equity method investees.\\nRevenue Recognition \\nOur Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations under the terms of the contracts with our customers are \\nsatisfied. Our performance obligation generally consists of the promise to sell concentrates, syrups or finished products to our \\nbottling partners, wholesalers, distributors or retailers. Refer to Note 3. \\nAdvertising Costs\\nOur Company expenses production costs of print, radio, television and other advertisements as of the first date the \\nadvertisements take place. All other marketing expenditures are expensed in the annual period in which the expenditure is \\nincurred. Advertising costs included in the line item selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements \\nof income were $5 billion, $4 billion and $4 billion in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, \\nadvertising and production costs of $43 million and $35 million, respectively, were primarily recorded in the line item prepaid \\nexpenses and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\\nShipping and Handling Costs\\nShipping and handling costs related to the movement of goods from our manufacturing locations to our sales distribution \\ncenters are included in the line item cost of goods sold in our consolidated statement of income. Shipping and handling costs \\nincurred to move goods from our manufacturing locations or sales distribution centers to our customers are also included in the \\nline item cost of goods sold in our consolidated statement of income, except for costs incurred to distribute goods sold by our \\nconsolidated bottlers to our customers, which are included in the line item selling, general and administrative expenses in our \\nconsolidated statement of income. Our customers generally do not pay us separately for shipping and handling costs. We \\nrecognize the cost of shipping and handling activities that are performed after a customer obtains control of the goods as costs \\nto fulfill our promise to provide goods to the customer. As a result of this election, the Company does not evaluate whether \\nshipping and handling activities are services promised to customers. If revenue is recognized for the related goods before the \\nshipping and handling activities occur, the related costs of those shipping and handling activities are accrued.\\nSales, Use, Value-Added and Excise Taxes\\nThe Company collects taxes imposed directly on its customers related to sales, use, value-added, excise and other similar taxes. \\nThe Company then remits such taxes on behalf of its customers to the applicable governmental authorities. We exclude from \\nnet operating revenues the tax amounts imposed on revenue-producing transactions that were collected from our customers to \\nbe remitted to governmental authorities. Accordingly, such tax amounts are recorded in the line item trade accounts receivable \\nin our consolidated balance sheet when collection of taxes from the customer has not yet occurred and are recorded in the line \\nitem accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet until they are remitted to the applicable \\ngovernmental authorities. Taxes imposed directly on the Company, whether based on receipts from sales, inventory \\nprocurement costs or manufacturing activities, are recorded in the line item cost of goods sold in our consolidated statement of \\nincome. \\nNet Income Per Share\\nBasic net income per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to shareowners of The Coca-Cola Company by the \\nweighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted net income per share is computed \\nsimilarly to basic net income per share, except that it includes the potential dilution that could occur if dilutive securities were \\nexercised. We excluded 8 million, 8 million and 6 million stock options from the computation of diluted net income per share in \\n2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, because the stock options would have been antidilutive. \\nCash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents\\nWe classify time deposits and other investments that are highly liquid and have maturities of three months or less at the date of \\npurchase as cash equivalents or restricted cash equivalents, as applicable. Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents \\ngenerally consist of amounts held by our captive insurance companies, which are included in the line item other noncurrent \\nassets in our consolidated balance sheet. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit \\nstandards, diversification of counterparties and procedures to monitor our concentrations of credit risk. \\n67\\nThe following table provides a summary of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents that constitute \\nthe total amounts shown in our consolidated statements of cash flows (in millions):\\nDecember 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nCash and cash equivalents\\n$ \\n9,366 $ \\n9,519 $ \\n9,684 \\nRestricted cash and restricted cash equivalents1,2\\n \\n326  \\n306  \\n341 \\nCash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents\\n$ \\n9,692 $ \\n9,825 $ \\n10,025 \\n1 Amounts include cash and cash equivalents in our solvency capital portfolio, which are included in the line item other noncurrent assets in \\nour consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 4.\\n2 Amounts include cash and cash equivalents related to assets held for sale, which are included in the line item prepaid expenses and other \\ncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 2. \\nShort-Term Investments\\nWe classify time deposits and other investments that have maturities of greater than three months but less than one year as \\nshort-term investments.\\nInvestments in Equity and Debt Securities\\nWe measure all equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair \\nvalue with the change in fair value included in net income. We use quoted market prices to determine the fair value of equity \\nsecurities with readily determinable fair values. For equity securities without readily determinable fair values, we have elected \\nthe measurement alternative under which we measure these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus \\nchanges resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same \\nissuer. Management assesses each of these investments on an individual basis. Our investments in debt securities are carried at \\neither amortized cost or fair value. Investments in debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to \\nmaturity are carried at amortized cost and classified as held-to-maturity. Investments in debt securities that are not classified as \\nheld-to-maturity are carried at fair value and classified as either trading or available-for-sale. Refer to Note 4 for additional \\ninformation on our policy for investments, which includes our assessment of impairments. \\nTrade Accounts Receivable\\nWe record trade accounts receivable at net realizable value. This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated \\nuncollectible accounts to reflect any expected loss on the trade accounts receivable balances and charged to the provision for \\ndoubtful accounts. We calculate this allowance based on available relevant information, in addition to historical loss \\ninformation, the level of past-due accounts based on the contractual terms of the receivables, and our relationships with, and the \\neconomic status of, our bottling partners and customers. We believe our exposure to concentrations of credit risk is limited due \\nto the diverse geographic areas covered by our operations. \\nThe Company has a trade accounts receivable factoring program in certain countries. Under this program, we can elect to sell \\ntrade accounts receivables to unaffiliated financial institutions at a discount. In these factoring arrangements, for ease of \\nadministration, the Company collects customer payments related to the factored receivables and remits those payments to the \\nfinancial institutions. The Company sold $17,704 million and $10,709 million of trade accounts receivables under this program \\nduring the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The costs of factoring such receivables were $83 million and \\n$27 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company accounts for this program as a sale, \\nand accordingly, the trade receivables sold are excluded from the line item trade accounts receivable in our consolidated \\nbalance sheet. The cash received from the financial institutions is classified within the operating activities section in our \\nconsolidated statement of cash flows.\\nInventories\\nInventories consist primarily of raw materials and packaging (which include ingredients and supplies) and finished goods \\n(which include concentrates and syrups in our concentrate operations and finished beverages in our finished product \\noperations). Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We determine cost on the basis of the average \\ncost or first-in, first-out methods. \\n68\\nInventories consisted of the following (in millions):\\nDecember 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\nRaw materials and packaging\\n$ \\n2,618 $ \\n2,627 \\nFinished goods\\n \\n1,449  \\n1,247 \\nOther\\n \\n357  \\n359 \\nTotal inventories\\n$ \\n4,424 $ \\n4,233 \\nDerivative Instruments\\nWhen deemed appropriate, our Company uses derivatives as a risk management tool to mitigate the potential impact of certain \\nmarket risks. The primary market risks managed by the Company through the use of derivative instruments are foreign currency \\nexchange rate risk, commodity price risk and interest rate risk. All derivatives are carried at fair value in our consolidated \\nbalance sheet in the following line items, as applicable: prepaid expenses and other current assets; other noncurrent assets; \\naccounts payable and accrued expenses; and other noncurrent liabilities. The cash flow impact of the Company’s derivative \\ninstruments is primarily included in our consolidated statement of cash flows in net cash provided by operating activities. Refer \\nto Note 5.\\nLeases \\nWe determine if a contract contains a lease at its inception based on whether or not the Company has the right to control the \\nasset during the contract period and other facts and circumstances. We are the lessee in a lease contract when we obtain the \\nright to control the asset. Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease \\nterm and are included in the line item other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease liabilities \\nrepresent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease and are included in the line items accounts payable and \\naccrued expenses and other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease ROU assets and operating \\nlease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the \\ncommencement date. When determining the lease term, we include renewal or termination options that we are reasonably \\ncertain to exercise. Leases with a lease term of 12 months or less at inception are not recorded in our consolidated balance \\nsheet. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term in our consolidated statement of \\nincome. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, we use our local incremental borrowing rate based on the \\ninformation available at the commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. When our contracts \\ncontain lease and non-lease components, we account for both components as a single lease component. Refer to Note 10.\\nWe have various contracts for certain fountain equipment under which we are the lessor. These leases meet the criteria for \\noperating lease classification. Lease income associated with these leases is not material.\\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Repair and maintenance costs that do not improve service potential or extend \\neconomic life are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is recorded principally by the straight-line method over the estimated \\nuseful lives of our assets, which are reviewed periodically and generally have the following ranges: buildings and \\nimprovements: 40 years or less; and machinery and equipment: 20 years or less. Land is not depreciated, and construction in \\nprogress is not depreciated until ready for service. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over \\nthe shorter of the remaining lease term, including renewal options that we are reasonably certain to exercise, or the estimated \\nuseful life of the improvement. Depreciation is not recorded during the period in which a long-lived asset or disposal group is \\nclassified as held for sale, even if the asset or disposal group continues to generate revenue during the period. Depreciation \\nexpense, including the depreciation expense of assets under finance leases, totaled $1,018 million, $1,125 million and \\n$1,262 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Amortization expense for leasehold improvements totaled $14 million, \\n$13 million and $15 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. \\n69\\nThe following table summarizes our property, plant and equipment (in millions):\\nDecember 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\nLand\\n$ \\n229 $ \\n611 \\nBuildings and improvements\\n \\n4,647  \\n4,434 \\nMachinery and equipment\\n \\n13,593  \\n14,030 \\nProperty, plant and equipment — cost\\n \\n18,469  \\n19,075 \\nLess: Accumulated depreciation\\n \\n9,233  \\n9,234 \\nProperty, plant and equipment — net\\n$ \\n9,236 $ \\n9,841 \\nCertain events or changes in circumstances may indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount of property, plant and \\nequipment should be assessed, including, among others, a significant decrease in market value, a significant change in the \\nbusiness climate in a particular market, or a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with historical losses or \\nprojected future losses. When such events or changes in circumstances are present and a recoverability test is performed, we \\nestimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. These \\nestimated future cash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash \\nflows (undiscounted and without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment charge. The \\nimpairment charge recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the fair value. \\nWe use a variety of methodologies to determine the fair value of property, plant and equipment, including appraisals and \\ndiscounted cash flow models. These appraisals and models include assumptions we believe are consistent with those a market \\nparticipant would use.\\nGoodwill, Trademarks and Other Intangible Assets\\nWe classify intangible assets into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization; (2) intangible \\nassets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization; and (3) goodwill. We determine the useful lives of our identifiable \\nintangible assets after considering the specific facts and circumstances related to each intangible asset. Factors we consider \\nwhen determining useful lives include the contractual term of any agreement related to the asset, the historical performance of \\nthe asset, the Company’s long-term strategy for using the asset, any laws or other local regulations which could impact the \\nuseful life of the asset, and other economic factors, including competition and specific market conditions. Intangible assets that \\nare deemed to have definite lives are amortized, primarily on a straight-line basis, over their useful lives, which is less than     \\n20 years. Refer to Note 7.\\nWhen events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of definite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable, \\nmanagement performs a recoverability test of the carrying value by preparing estimates of sales volume and the resulting profit \\nand cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition. These estimated future \\ncash flows are consistent with those we use in our internal planning. If the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted \\nand without interest charges) is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment charge. The impairment charge \\nrecognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the fair value. We use a variety of \\nmethodologies to determine the fair value of these assets, including discounted cash flow models, which include assumptions \\nwe believe are consistent with those a market participant would use.\\nWe test intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives, including trademarks, franchise rights and goodwill, for \\nimpairment annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired. Our Company \\nperforms these annual impairment tests as of the first day of our third fiscal quarter. We perform impairment tests using various \\nvaluation methodologies, including discounted cash flow models and a market approach, to determine the fair value of the \\nindefinite-lived intangible asset or the reporting unit, as applicable. We believe our assumptions are consistent with those a \\nmarket participant would use. For indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair \\nvalue, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The Company has the option to perform a \\nqualitative assessment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, other than goodwill, rather than completing the impairment test. The \\nCompany must assess whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying \\namount. If the Company concludes that this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing described above. Otherwise, the \\nCompany does not need to perform any further assessment. \\nWe perform impairment tests of goodwill at our reporting unit level, which is generally one level below our operating \\nsegments. Our operating segments are primarily based on geographic responsibility, which is consistent with the way \\nmanagement runs our business. Our geographic operating segments are generally subdivided into smaller geographic regions. \\nThese geographic regions are our reporting units. Our Global Ventures operating segment includes the results of our Costa \\nLimited (“Costa”), innocent and doğadan businesses, as well as fees earned pursuant to distribution coordination agreements \\n70\\nbetween the Company and Monster Beverage Corporation (“Monster”), each of which is its own reporting unit. The Bottling \\nInvestments operating segment includes all of our consolidated bottling operations, regardless of geographic location. \\nGenerally, each consolidated bottling operation within our Bottling Investments operating segment is its own reporting unit. \\nGoodwill is assigned to the reporting unit or units that benefit from the synergies arising from each business combination.\\nIn order to test for goodwill impairment, the Company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value, \\nincluding goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill is written down for the \\namount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. However, the impairment charge recognized cannot exceed the \\ncarrying amount of goodwill. The Company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill in order to \\ndetermine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the \\nCompany concludes that this is the case, it must perform the impairment testing discussed above. Otherwise, the Company does \\nnot need to perform any further assessment. \\nImpairment charges related to intangible assets, including goodwill, are generally recorded in the line item other operating \\ncharges or, to the extent they relate to equity method investees, in the line item equity income (loss) — net in our consolidated \\nstatement of income.\\nContingencies\\nOur Company is involved in various legal proceedings and tax matters. Due to their nature, such legal proceedings and tax \\nmatters involve inherent uncertainties, including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties and \\ngovernmental actions. Management assesses the probability of loss for such contingencies and accrues a liability and/or \\ndiscloses the relevant circumstances, as appropriate. Refer to Note 12.\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nOur Company grants long-term equity awards under its stock-based compensation plans to certain employees of the Company. \\nThese awards include stock options, performance share units, restricted stock and restricted stock units. The fair value of stock \\noption awards is estimated using a Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The Company recognizes compensation \\nexpense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is generally four years.\\nThe fair value of restricted stock, restricted stock units and certain performance share units is the closing market price per share \\nof the Company’s stock on the grant date less the present value of the expected dividends not received during the vesting \\nperiod. The Company included a relative total shareowner return (“TSR”) modifier for performance share unit awards granted \\nto executives from 2018 through 2022 as well as for performance share unit awards granted to all participants in 2023. For these \\nawards, the number of performance share units earned based on the certified achievement of the predefined performance criteria \\nwill be reduced or increased if the Company’s total shareowner return over the performance period relative to a predefined \\ngroup of companies falls outside of a predefined range. The fair value of performance share units that include a TSR modifier is \\ndetermined using a Monte Carlo valuation model. \\nIn the reporting period it becomes probable that the minimum performance threshold specified in the performance share unit \\naward will be achieved, we recognize compensation expense for the proportionate share of the total fair value of the \\nperformance share units related to the vesting period that has already lapsed for the performance share units expected to vest. \\nThe remaining fair value of the performance share units expected to vest is expensed on a straight-line basis over the remainder \\nof the vesting period. In the event the Company determines it is no longer probable that the minimum performance threshold \\nspecified in the award will be achieved, we reverse all of the previously recognized compensation expense in the reporting \\nperiod such a determination is made. \\nThe Company has made a policy election to estimate the number of stock-based compensation awards that will ultimately vest \\nto determine the amount of compensation expense recognized each reporting period. Forfeiture estimates are trued-up at the end \\nof each quarter in order to ensure that compensation expense is recognized only for those awards that ultimately vest. Refer to \\nNote 13.\\nIncome Taxes\\nIncome tax expense includes U.S., state, local and international income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized \\nfor the tax consequences of temporary differences between the book basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The tax rate \\nused to determine the deferred tax assets and liabilities is the enacted tax rate for the year and manner in which the differences \\nare expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than \\nnot be realized. \\nThe Company is involved in various tax matters, with respect to some of which the outcome is uncertain. We establish reserves \\nto remove some or all of the tax benefit of any of our tax positions at the time we determine that it becomes uncertain based \\n71\\nupon one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is not “more likely than not” to be sustained; (2) the tax position is \\n“more likely than not” to be sustained, but for a lesser amount; or (3) the tax position is “more likely than not” to be sustained, \\nbut not in the financial period in which the tax position was originally taken. For purposes of evaluating whether or not a tax \\nposition is uncertain, (1) we presume the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge \\nof all relevant information; (2) the technical merits of a tax position are derived from authorities such as legislation and statutes, \\nlegislative intent, regulations, rulings and caselaw and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position; and \\n(3) each tax position is evaluated without consideration of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other tax positions taken. \\nA number of years may elapse before a particular uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved or when a tax assessment \\nis raised. The number of years subject to tax assessments varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been \\npreviously reserved because of a failure to meet the “more likely than not” recognition threshold would be recognized in \\nincome tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty disappears under any one of the following conditions: \\n(1) the tax position is “more likely than not” to be sustained; (2) the tax position, amount and/or timing is ultimately settled \\nthrough negotiation or litigation; or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Refer to Note 12 and Note 15.\\nTranslation and Remeasurement\\nWe translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries from their respective functional currencies to U.S. dollars at the \\nappropriate spot rates as of the balance sheet date. Generally, our foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional \\ncurrency. Changes in the carrying values of these assets and liabilities attributable to fluctuations in spot rates are recognized in \\nnet foreign currency translation adjustments, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”). Refer \\nto Note 16. Accounts in our consolidated statement of income are translated using the monthly average exchange rates during \\nthe year.\\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency that is different from a reporting entity’s functional currency must be \\nremeasured from the applicable currency to the reporting entity’s functional currency. The effects of the remeasurement of \\nthese assets and liabilities are recognized in the line item other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income and \\nare partially offset by the impact of our economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated balance sheet. \\nRefer to Note 5.\\nRecently Issued Accounting Guidance\\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic \\n280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which expands annual and interim disclosure requirements for \\nreportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The expanded annual \\ndisclosures are effective for our year ending December 31, 2024, and the expanded interim disclosures are effective in 2025 and \\nwill be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2023-07 \\nwill have on our consolidated financial statements.\\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, \\nwhich requires, among other things, additional disclosures primarily related to the income tax rate reconciliation and income \\ntaxes paid. The expanded annual disclosures are effective for our year ending December 31, 2025. The Company is currently \\nevaluating the impact that ASU 2023-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and whether we will apply the \\nstandard prospectively or retrospectively.\\nNOTE 2: ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES \\nAcquisitions\\nOur Company’s acquisitions of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $62 million and \\n$73 million during 2023 and 2022, respectively. During 2021, our Company’s acquisitions of businesses, equity method \\ninvestments and nonmarketable securities totaled $4,766 million, which primarily related to the acquisition of the remaining \\nownership interest in BA Sports Nutrition, LLC (“BodyArmor”).\\nBA Sports Nutrition, LLC \\nIn November 2021, the Company acquired the remaining 85% ownership interest in, and now owns 100% of, BodyArmor, \\nwhich offers a line of sports performance and hydration beverages in the United States. We acquired the remaining ownership \\ninterest in exchange for approximately $5,600 million of cash, of which $4,745 million was paid at close, net of cash acquired. \\nThe purchase price reflected the contractual discount included in the purchase option we obtained with our initial investment in \\n2018. The remaining $860 million of the purchase price was held back related to indemnification obligations, of which \\n$549 million had been paid as of December 31, 2022 and $311 million was paid in 2023. Upon consolidation, we recognized a \\ngain of $834 million resulting from the remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in BodyArmor to fair value, which \\n72\\nwas recorded in the line item other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income. The fair value of our \\npreviously held equity interest was determined using a discounted cash flow model based on Level 3 inputs, as defined in \\nNote 17. Upon finalization of purchase accounting, $4.2 billion of the purchase price was allocated to the BodyArmor \\ntrademark and $2.2 billion was allocated to goodwill, of which $1.2 billion is tax deductible. The goodwill recognized as part of \\nthis acquisition is primarily related to the synergistic value created from leveraging the capabilities, assets and scale of the \\nCompany and the opportunity for international expansion. It also includes certain other intangible assets that do not qualify for \\nseparate recognition, such as an assembled workforce. Of the total amount allocated to goodwill, $1.9 billion has been assigned \\nto the North America operating segment and $0.3 billion has been assigned to our other geographic operating segments. \\nDivestitures\\nDuring 2023, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled \\n$430 million, which primarily related to sales of our ownership interests in our equity method investees in Indonesia and \\nPakistan, for which we received cash proceeds of $402 million and a note receivable of $200 million. We recognized a net gain \\nof $94 million as a result of these transactions.\\nDuring 2022, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled \\n$458 million, which primarily related to the refranchising of our bottling operations in Cambodia. We received net cash \\nproceeds of $228 million and recognized a net gain of $153 million as a result of the refranchising. Also included was the sale \\nof our ownership interest in one of our equity method investees, for which we received cash proceeds of $123 million and \\nrecognized a net gain of $13 million.\\nDuring 2021, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled \\n$2,180 million, which primarily related to the sale of our ownership interest in Coca-Cola Amatil Limited (“CCA”), an equity \\nmethod investee, to Coca-Cola Europacific Partners plc (“CCEP”), also an equity method investee. We received cash proceeds \\nof $1,738 million and recognized a net gain of $695 million as a result of the sale and the related reversal of cumulative \\ntranslation adjustments. Also included were the sale of our ownership interest in an equity method investee and the sale of a \\nportion of our ownership interest in another equity method investee. We received cash proceeds of $293 million and recognized \\na net gain of $114 million as a result of these sales. \\nAll of the gains and losses discussed above were recorded in the line item other income (loss) — net in our consolidated \\nstatements of income.\\nAssets and Liabilities Held for Sale\\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company’s bottling operations in the Philippines and Bangladesh and certain bottling operations \\nin India met the criteria to be classified as held for sale and are expected to be refranchised during the first quarter of 2024. As \\nof December 31, 2022, the Company’s bottling operations in Vietnam met the criteria to be classified as held for sale. As a \\nresult, we were required to record the related assets and liabilities at the lower of carrying value or fair value less any costs to \\nsell. As the fair values less any costs to sell exceeded the carrying values, the related assets and liabilities were recorded at their \\ncarrying values. These assets and liabilities were included in the Bottling Investments operating segment. \\nIn December 2022, the Company received cash proceeds of $823 million in advance of refranchising its bottling operations in \\nVietnam. This advance was included in the line item accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet \\nas of December 31, 2022, and was included in the line item other investing activities in our consolidated statement of cash \\nflows for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company refranchised its bottling operations in Vietnam in January 2023 and \\nrecognized a net gain of $439 million as a result of the sale, which was recorded in the line item other income (loss) — net in \\nour consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2023. \\n73\\nThe following table presents information related to the major classes of assets and liabilities that were classified as held for sale \\nand were included in the line items prepaid expenses and other current assets and accounts payable and accrued expenses, \\nrespectively, in our consolidated balance sheets (in millions):\\nDecember 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments\\n$ \\n37 $ \\n229 \\nMarketable securities\\n \\n8  \\n— \\nTrade accounts receivable, less allowances\\n \\n95  \\n12 \\nInventories\\n \\n299  \\n50 \\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\\n \\n60  \\n43 \\nEquity method investments\\n \\n4  \\n— \\nOther noncurrent assets\\n \\n51  \\n29 \\nDeferred income tax assets\\n \\n28  \\n8 \\nProperty, plant and equipment — net\\n \\n1,267  \\n197 \\nGoodwill\\n \\n231  \\n34 \\nOther intangible assets\\n \\n14  \\n— \\n  Assets held for sale\\n$ \\n2,094 $ \\n602 \\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\\n$ \\n464 $ \\n154 \\nLoans and notes payable\\n \\n63  \\n— \\nAccrued income taxes\\n \\n24  \\n3 \\nLong-term debt\\n \\n2  \\n— \\nOther noncurrent liabilities\\n \\n108  \\n3 \\nDeferred income tax liabilities\\n \\n58  \\n— \\n  Liabilities held for sale\\n$ \\n719 $ \\n160 \\nNOTE 3: NET OPERATING REVENUES \\nOur Company operates in two lines of business: concentrate operations and finished product operations.\\nOur concentrate operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling beverage concentrates, sometimes referred to as \\n“beverage bases,” syrups, including fountain syrups, and certain finished beverages to authorized bottling operations (to which \\nwe typically refer as our “bottlers” or our “bottling partners”). Our bottling partners either combine concentrates with still or \\nsparkling water and sweeteners (depending on the product), or combine syrups with still or sparkling water, to produce finished \\nbeverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers, such as cans and refillable and nonrefillable glass and \\nplastic bottles, bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, \\nthrough wholesalers or other bottlers. In addition, outside the United States, our bottling partners are typically authorized to \\nmanufacture fountain syrups, using our concentrates, which they sell to fountain retailers for use in producing beverages for \\nimmediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain \\nretailers. Our concentrate operations are included in our geographic operating segments and our Global Ventures operating \\nsegment.\\nOur finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling soft drinks and a variety of other finished \\nbeverages to retailers, or to distributors and wholesalers who in turn sell the beverages to retailers. Generally, finished product \\noperations generate higher net operating revenues but lower gross profit margins than concentrate operations. These operations \\nconsist primarily of our consolidated bottling and distribution operations, which are included in our Bottling Investments \\noperating segment. In certain markets, the Company also operates non-bottling finished product operations in which we sell \\nfinished beverages to distributors and wholesalers that are generally not one of the Company’s bottling partners. These \\noperations are generally included in one of our geographic operating segments or our Global Ventures operating segment. \\nAdditionally, we sell directly to consumers through retail stores operated by Costa. These sales are included in our Global \\nVentures operating segment. In the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers, who use \\nthe fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners \\nwho in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. These fountain syrup sales are included in our North \\nAmerica operating segment.\\n74\\nRevenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contracts with our customers are satisfied. Our \\nperformance obligation generally consists of the promise to sell concentrates, syrups or finished products to our bottling \\npartners, wholesalers, distributors or retailers. Control of the concentrates, syrups or finished products is transferred upon \\nshipment to, or receipt at, our customers’ locations, as determined by the specific terms of the contract. Upon transfer of control \\nto the customer, which completes our performance obligation, revenue is recognized. Our sales terms generally do not allow for \\na right of return except for matters related to any manufacturing defects on our part. After completion of our performance \\nobligation, we have an unconditional right to consideration as outlined in the contract. Our receivables will generally be \\ncollected in less than six months, in accordance with the underlying payment terms. All of our performance obligations under \\nthe terms of contracts with our customers have an original duration of one year or less.\\nOur customers and bottling partners may be entitled to cash discounts, funds for promotional and marketing activities, volume-\\nbased incentive programs, support for infrastructure programs and other similar programs. In most markets, in an effort to allow \\nour Company and our bottling partners to grow together through shared value, aligned financial objectives and the flexibility \\nnecessary to meet consumers’ always changing needs and tastes, we have implemented an incidence-based concentrate pricing \\nmodel. Under this model, the price we charge bottlers for concentrates they use to prepare and package finished products is \\nimpacted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the prices charged by the bottlers for such finished products, the \\nchannels in which they are sold, and package mix. The amounts associated with the arrangements described above represent \\nvariable consideration, an estimate of which is included in the transaction price as a component of net operating revenues in our \\nconsolidated statement of income upon completion of our performance obligations. The total revenue recorded, including any \\nvariable consideration, cannot exceed the amount for which it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur when \\nuncertainties related to variability are resolved. As a result, we are recognizing revenue based on our faithful depiction of the \\nconsideration that we expect to receive. In making our estimates of variable consideration, we consider past results and make \\nsignificant assumptions related to: (1) customer sales volumes; (2) customer ending inventories; (3) customer selling price per \\nunit; (4) selling channels; and (5) discount rates, rebates and other pricing allowances, as applicable. In gathering data to \\nestimate our variable consideration, we generally calculate our estimates using a portfolio approach at the country and product \\nline level rather than at the individual contract level. The result of making these estimates will impact the line items trade \\naccounts receivable or accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet, as applicable. The actual \\namounts ultimately paid and/or received may be different from our estimates. The change in the amount of variable \\nconsideration recognized during the year ended December 31, 2023 related to performance obligations satisfied in prior periods \\nwas immaterial.\\nThe following table presents net operating revenues disaggregated between the United States and International and further by \\nline of business (in millions):\\nUnited States\\nInternational\\nTotal\\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\\nConcentrate operations\\n$ \\n8,780 $ \\n17,759 $ \\n26,539 \\nFinished product operations\\n \\n7,770  \\n11,445  \\n19,215 \\nTotal \\n$ \\n16,550 $ \\n29,204 $ \\n45,754 \\nYear Ended December 31, 2022\\nConcentrate operations\\n$ \\n7,702 $ \\n16,369 $ \\n24,071 \\nFinished product operations\\n \\n7,711  \\n11,222  \\n18,933 \\nTotal \\n$ \\n15,413 $ \\n27,591 $ \\n43,004 \\nYear Ended December 31, 2021\\nConcentrate operations\\n$ \\n6,551 $ \\n15,248 $ \\n21,799 \\nFinished product operations\\n \\n6,459  \\n10,397  \\n16,856 \\nTotal\\n$ \\n13,010 $ \\n25,645 $ \\n38,655 \\nRefer to Note 20 for additional revenue disclosures by operating segment and Corporate.\\n75\\nNOTE 4: INVESTMENTS \\nWe measure all equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair \\nvalue with the change in fair value included in net income. We use quoted market prices to determine the fair values of equity \\nsecurities with readily determinable fair values. For equity securities without readily determinable fair values, we have elected \\nthe measurement alternative under which we measure these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus \\nchanges resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same \\nissuer. Management assesses each of these investments on an individual basis.\\nOur investments in debt securities are carried at either amortized cost or fair value. The cost basis is determined by the specific \\nidentification method. Investments in debt securities that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are \\ncarried at amortized cost and classified as held-to-maturity. Investments in debt securities that are not classified as held-to-\\nmaturity are carried at fair value and classified as either trading or available-for-sale. Realized and unrealized gains and losses \\non trading debt securities as well as realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are included in net income. \\nUnrealized gains and losses, net of tax, on available-for-sale debt securities are included in our consolidated balance sheet as a \\ncomponent of AOCI, except for the changes in fair values attributable to the currency risk being hedged, if applicable, which \\nare included in net income. Refer to Note 5 for additional information related to the Company’s fair value hedges of available-\\nfor-sale debt securities.\\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values that are not accounted for under the equity method and debt securities \\nclassified as trading are not assessed for impairment, since they are carried at fair value with the change in fair value included in \\nnet income. Equity method investments, equity securities without readily determinable fair values and debt securities classified \\nas available-for-sale or held-to-maturity are reviewed each reporting period to determine whether a significant event or change \\nin circumstances has occurred that may have an adverse effect on the fair value of each investment. When such events or \\nchanges occur, we evaluate the fair value compared to our cost basis in the investment. We also perform this evaluation every \\nreporting period for each investment for which our cost basis has exceeded the fair value. The fair values of most of our \\nCompany’s investments in publicly traded companies are readily available based on quoted market prices. For investments in \\nnonpublicly traded companies, management’s assessment of fair value is based on various valuation methodologies, including \\ndiscounted cash flows, estimates of sales proceeds, and appraisals, as appropriate. We consider the assumptions that we believe \\na market participant would use in evaluating estimated future cash flows when employing the discounted cash flow or estimates \\nof sales proceeds valuation methodologies. The ability to accurately predict future cash flows, especially in emerging and \\ndeveloping markets, may impact the determination of fair value. In the event the fair value of an investment declines below our \\ncost basis, management is required to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. If management determines \\nthe decline is other than temporary, an impairment charge is recorded. Management’s assessment as to the nature of a decline in \\nfair value is based on, among other things, the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than our \\ncost basis; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a \\nperiod of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.\\nEquity Securities\\nThe carrying values of our equity securities were included in the following line items in our consolidated balance sheets (in \\nmillions):\\nFair Value with \\nChanges \\nRecognized in \\nIncome\\nMeasurement \\nAlternative — \\nNo Readily \\nDeterminable\\nFair Value\\nDecember 31, 2023\\nMarketable securities\\n$ \\n345 $ \\n— \\nOther investments\\n \\n76  \\n42 \\nOther noncurrent assets\\n \\n1,585  \\n— \\nTotal equity securities\\n$ \\n2,006 $ \\n42 \\nDecember 31, 2022\\nMarketable securities\\n$ \\n308 $ \\n— \\nOther investments\\n \\n459  \\n42 \\nOther noncurrent assets\\n \\n1,303  \\n— \\nTotal equity securities\\n$ \\n2,070 $ \\n42 \\n76\\nThe calculation of net unrealized gains and losses recognized during the year related to equity securities still held at the end of \\nthe year is as follows (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31, \\n2023\\n2022\\nNet gains (losses) recognized during the year related to equity securities  \\n$ \\n371 $ \\n(236) \\nLess: Net gains (losses) recognized during the year related to equity securities sold during\\n   the year \\n \\n52  \\n7 \\nNet unrealized gains (losses) recognized during the year related to equity securities still held at\\n   the end of the year\\n$ \\n319 $ \\n(243) \\nDebt Securities\\nOur debt securities consisted of the following (in millions):\\nGross Unrealized\\nEstimated Fair \\nValue\\nCost\\nGains\\nLosses\\nDecember 31, 2023\\nTrading securities\\n$ \\n43 $ \\n— $ \\n(2) $ \\n41 \\nAvailable-for-sale securities\\n \\n1,136  \\n26  \\n(28)  \\n1,134 \\nTotal debt securities\\n$ \\n1,179 $ \\n26 $ \\n(30) $ \\n1,175 \\nDecember 31, 2022\\nTrading securities\\n$ \\n43 $ \\n— $ \\n(4) $ \\n39 \\nAvailable-for-sale securities\\n \\n979  \\n26  \\n(61)  \\n944 \\nTotal debt securities\\n$ \\n1,022 $ \\n26 $ \\n(65) $ \\n983 \\nThe carrying values of our debt securities were included in the following line items in our consolidated balance sheets (in \\nmillions):\\nDecember 31, 2023\\nDecember 31, 2022\\nTrading \\nSecurities\\nAvailable-for-\\nSale Securities\\nTrading \\nSecurities\\nAvailable-for-\\nSale Securities\\nMarketable securities\\n$ \\n41 $ \\n914 \\n$ \\n39 $ \\n722 \\nOther noncurrent assets\\n \\n—  \\n220 \\n \\n—  \\n222 \\nTotal debt securities\\n$ \\n41 $ \\n1,134 \\n$ \\n39 $ \\n944 \\nThe contractual maturities of these available-for-sale debt securities as of December 31, 2023 were as follows (in millions):\\nCost\\nEstimated \\nFair Value\\nWithin 1 year\\n$ \\n484 $ \\n483 \\nAfter 1 year through 5 years\\n \\n420  \\n427 \\nAfter 5 years through 10 years\\n \\n37  \\n48 \\nAfter 10 years\\n \\n195  \\n176 \\nTotal\\n$ \\n1,136 $ \\n1,134 \\nThe Company expects that actual maturities may differ from the contractual maturities above because borrowers have the right \\nto call or prepay certain obligations.\\nThe sale and/or maturity of available-for-sale debt securities resulted in the following realized activity (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nGross gains\\n$ \\n3 $ \\n5 $ \\n6 \\nGross losses\\n \\n(10)  \\n(136)  \\n(10) \\nProceeds\\n \\n361  \\n1,498  \\n1,197 \\n77\\nCaptive Insurance Companies\\nIn accordance with local insurance regulations, our consolidated captive insurance companies are required to meet and maintain \\nminimum solvency capital requirements.

This captive’s solvency capital funds included total equity and debt securities of \\n$1,643 million and $1,378 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which were classified in the line item other \\nnoncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheets because the assets were not available to satisfy our current obligations.\\nNOTE 5: HEDGING TRANSACTIONS AND DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \\nThe Company is directly and indirectly affected by changes in certain market conditions. These changes in market conditions \\nmay adversely impact the Company’s financial performance and are referred to as “market risks.” When deemed appropriate, \\nour Company uses derivatives as a risk management tool to mitigate the potential impact of certain market risks. The primary \\nmarket risks managed by the Company through the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments are foreign \\ncurrency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk and interest rate risk.\\nThe Company uses various types of derivative instruments, including, but not limited to, forward contracts, commodity futures \\ncontracts, option contracts, collars and swaps. Forward contracts and commodity futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell \\na quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined future date and at a predetermined rate or price. An option contract is \\nan agreement that conveys the purchaser the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at \\na predetermined rate or price during a period or at a time in the future. A collar is a strategy that uses a combination of options \\nto limit the range of possible positive or negative returns on an underlying asset or liability to a specific range, or to protect \\nexpected future cash flows. To do this, an investor simultaneously buys a put option and sells (writes) a call option, or \\nalternatively buys a call option and sells (writes) a put option. A swap agreement is a contract between two parties to exchange \\ncash flows based on specified underlying notional amounts, assets and/or indices. We do not enter into derivative financial \\ninstruments for trading purposes. The Company may also designate certain non-derivative instruments, such as our foreign \\ncurrency denominated third-party debt, in hedging relationships.\\nAll derivative instruments are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily in the following line items, as \\napplicable: prepaid expenses and other current assets; other noncurrent assets; accounts payable and accrued expenses; and \\nother noncurrent liabilities. The carrying values of the derivatives reflect the impact of legally enforceable master netting \\nagreements and cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparties, as applicable. These master netting agreements \\nallow the Company to net settle positive and negative positions (assets and liabilities) arising from different transactions with \\nthe same counterparty.\\nThe accounting for gains and losses that result from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments depends on whether the \\nderivatives have been designated and qualify as hedging instruments and the type of hedging relationships. Derivatives can be \\ndesignated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. The changes in the fair \\nvalues of derivatives that have been designated and qualify for fair value hedge accounting are recorded in the same line item in \\nour consolidated statement of income as the changes in the fair values of the hedged items attributable to the risk being hedged. \\nThe changes in the fair values of derivatives that have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges or hedges of net \\ninvestments in foreign operations are recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into the line item in our consolidated statement of \\nincome in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period the hedged items affect earnings. Due to the high degree of \\neffectiveness between the hedging instruments and the underlying exposures being hedged, fluctuations in the values of the \\nderivative instruments are generally offset by changes in the fair values or cash flows of the underlying exposures being \\nhedged. The changes in the fair values of derivatives that were not designated and/or did not qualify as hedging instruments are \\nimmediately recognized in earnings.\\nFor derivatives that will be accounted for as hedging instruments, the Company formally designates and documents, at \\ninception, the financial instrument as a hedge of a specific underlying exposure, the risk management objective and the strategy \\nfor undertaking the hedge transaction. In addition, the Company formally assesses, both at inception and at least quarterly \\nthereafter, whether the financial instruments used in hedging transactions are effective at offsetting changes in either the fair \\nvalues or cash flows of the related underlying exposures. \\nThe Company determines the fair values of its derivatives based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current \\nmarket rates. Refer to Note 17. The notional amounts of the derivative financial instruments do not necessarily represent \\namounts exchanged by the parties and, therefore, are not a direct measure of our exposure to the financial risks described above. \\nThe amounts exchanged are calculated by reference to the notional amounts and by other terms of the derivatives, such as \\ninterest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity rates or other financial indices. The Company does not view the fair \\n78\\nvalues of its derivatives in isolation but rather in relation to the fair values or cash flows of the underlying hedged transactions \\nor other exposures. Virtually all of our derivatives are straightforward over-the-counter instruments with liquid markets.\\nThe following table presents the fair values of the Company’s derivative instruments that were designated and qualified as part \\nof a hedging relationship (in millions):\\n \\nFair Value1,2\\nDerivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments\\nFinancial Statement Line Item Impacted1\\nDecember 31,\\n2023\\nDecember 31,\\n2022\\nAssets:\\n \\n \\n \\nForeign currency contracts\\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\\n$ \\n109 $ \\n126 \\nForeign currency contracts\\nOther noncurrent assets\\n \\n13  \\n13 \\nInterest rate contracts\\nOther noncurrent assets\\n \\n50  \\n— \\nTotal assets\\n \\n$ \\n172 $ \\n139 \\nLiabilities:\\n \\n \\n \\nForeign currency contracts\\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\\n$ \\n111 $ \\n54 \\nForeign currency contracts\\nOther noncurrent liabilities\\n \\n40  \\n108 \\nCommodity contracts\\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\\n \\n3  \\n2 \\nInterest rate contracts\\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\\n \\n5  \\n— \\nInterest rate contracts\\nOther noncurrent liabilities\\n \\n1,113  \\n1,676 \\nTotal liabilities\\n \\n$ \\n1,272 $ \\n1,840 \\n1 All of the Company’s derivative instruments are carried at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets after considering the impact of \\nlegally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparties, as applicable.

Refer to Note 17 for the net presentation of the Company’s derivative instruments.\\n2 Refer to Note 17 for additional information related to the estimated fair value.\\n79\\nCredit Risk Associated with Derivatives\\nWe have established strict counterparty credit guidelines and enter into transactions only with financial institutions of \\ninvestment grade or better. We monitor counterparty exposures regularly and review any downgrade in credit rating \\nimmediately. If a downgrade in the credit rating of a counterparty were to occur, we have provisions requiring collateral for \\nsubstantially all of our transactions. To mitigate presettlement risk, minimum credit standards become more stringent as the \\nduration of the derivative financial instrument increases. In addition, the Company’s master netting agreements reduce credit \\nrisk by permitting the Company to net settle for transactions with the same counterparty. To minimize the concentration of \\ncredit risk, we enter into derivative transactions with a portfolio of financial institutions. Furthermore, for certain derivative \\nfinancial instruments, the Company has agreements with counterparties that require collateral to be exchanged based on \\nchanges in the fair value of the instruments. The Company classifies collateral payments and receipts as investing cash flows \\nwhen the collateral account is in an asset position and as financing cash flows when the collateral account is in a liability \\nposition. As a result of these factors, we consider the risk of counterparty default to be minimal. \\nCash Flow Hedging Strategy\\nThe Company uses cash flow hedges to minimize the variability in cash flows of assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions \\ncaused by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices or interest rates. The changes in the fair values of \\nderivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI and are reclassified into the line item in our consolidated \\nstatement of income in which the hedged items are recorded in the same period the hedged items affect earnings. The changes \\nin fair values of hedges that are determined to be ineffective are immediately reclassified from AOCI into earnings. The \\nmaximum length of time for which the Company hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows is typically three \\nyears.\\nThe Company maintains a foreign currency cash flow hedging program to reduce the risk that our U.S. dollar net cash inflows \\nfrom sales outside the United States and U.S. dollar net cash outflows from procurement activities will be adversely affected by \\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We enter into forward contracts and purchase foreign currency options and \\ncollars (principally euro, British pound and Japanese yen) to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in \\nforeign currencies. When the U.S. dollar strengthens against the foreign currencies, the decline in the present value of future \\nforeign currency cash flows is partially offset by gains in the fair value of the derivative instruments. Conversely, when the U.S. \\ndollar weakens, the increase in the present value of future foreign currency cash flows is partially offset by losses in the fair \\nvalue of the derivative instruments. The total notional values of derivatives that were designated and qualified for the \\nCompany’s foreign currency cash flow hedging program were $9,408 million and $5,510 million as of December 31, 2023 and \\n2022, respectively.\\nThe Company uses cross-currency swaps to hedge the changes in cash flows of certain of its foreign currency denominated debt \\nand other monetary assets or liabilities due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For this hedging program, the \\nCompany recognizes in earnings each period the changes in carrying values of these foreign currency denominated assets and \\nliabilities due to fluctuations in exchange rates. The changes in fair values of the cross-currency swap derivatives are recorded \\nin AOCI with an immediate reclassification into earnings for the changes in fair values attributable to fluctuations in foreign \\ncurrency exchange rates. The total notional value of derivatives that were designated as cash flow hedges for the Company’s \\nforeign currency denominated assets and liabilities was $958 million as of both December 31, 2023 and 2022.\\nThe Company has entered into commodity futures contracts and other derivative instruments on various commodities to \\nmitigate the price risk associated with forecasted purchases of materials used in our manufacturing process. These derivative \\ninstruments were designated as part of the Company’s commodity cash flow hedging program. The objective of this hedging \\nprogram is to reduce the variability of cash flows associated with future purchases of certain commodities. The total notional \\nvalues of derivatives that were designated and qualified for this program were $54 million and $35 million as of December 31, \\n2023 and 2022, respectively.\\nOur Company monitors our mix of short-term debt and long-term debt regularly. We manage our risk to interest rate \\nfluctuations through the use of derivative financial instruments. From time to time, the Company has entered into interest rate \\nswap agreements and has designated these instruments as part of the Company’s interest rate cash flow hedging program. The \\nobjective of this hedging program is to mitigate the risk of adverse changes in benchmark interest rates on the Company’s \\nfuture interest payments. The total notional value of derivatives that were designated and qualified for the Company’s interest \\nrate cash flow hedging program was $750 million as of December 31, 2023. There were no derivatives that were designated and \\nqualified for the Company’s interest rate cash flow hedging program as of December 31, 2022.\\n80\\nThe following table presents the pretax impact that changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges had \\non other comprehensive income (“OCI”), AOCI and earnings (in millions):\\nGain (Loss)\\nRecognized\\nin OCI\\nFinancial Statement Line Item Impacted\\nGain (Loss)\\nReclassified from\\nAOCI into Income\\n2023\\n \\n \\n \\nForeign currency contracts\\n$ \\n(128) Net operating revenues\\n$ \\n(3) \\nForeign currency contracts\\n \\n19 \\nCost of goods sold\\n \\n14 \\nForeign currency contracts\\n \\n— \\nInterest expense\\n \\n(4) \\nForeign currency contracts\\n \\n35 \\nOther income (loss) — net\\n \\n17 \\nCommodity contracts\\n \\n(15) Cost of goods sold\\n \\n(14) \\nTotal\\n$ \\n(89) \\n$ \\n10 \\n2022\\nForeign currency contracts\\n$ \\n205 \\nNet operating revenues\\n$ \\n218 \\nForeign currency contracts\\n \\n17 \\nCost of goods sold\\n \\n28 \\nForeign currency contracts\\n \\n— \\nInterest expense\\n \\n(4) \\nForeign currency contracts\\n \\n(91) Other income (loss) — net\\n \\n(79) \\nCommodity contracts\\n \\n(4) Cost of goods sold\\n \\n(2) \\nTotal\\n$ \\n127 \\n \\n$ \\n161 \\n2021\\nForeign currency contracts\\n$ \\n36 \\nNet operating revenues\\n$ \\n(77) \\nForeign currency contracts\\n \\n(2) Cost of goods sold\\n \\n(10) \\nForeign currency contracts\\n \\n— \\nInterest expense\\n \\n(13) \\nForeign currency contracts\\n \\n19 \\nOther income (loss) — net\\n \\n74 \\nInterest rate contracts\\n \\n110 \\nInterest expense\\n \\n(90) \\nCommodity contracts\\n \\n(1) Cost of goods sold\\n \\n— \\nTotal\\n$ \\n162 \\n$ \\n(116) \\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company estimates that it will reclassify into earnings during the next 12 months net losses of \\n$72 million from the pretax amount recorded in AOCI as the anticipated cash flows occur.\\nFair Value Hedging Strategy\\nThe Company uses interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges to minimize exposure to changes in the fair \\nvalue of fixed-rate debt that result from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates. The Company also uses cross-currency interest \\nrate swaps to hedge the changes in the fair value of foreign currency denominated debt relating to fluctuations in foreign \\ncurrency exchange rates and benchmark interest rates. The changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as fair value \\nhedges and the offsetting changes in the fair values of the hedged items are recognized in earnings. As a result, any difference is \\nreflected in earnings as ineffectiveness. When a derivative is no longer designated as a fair value hedge for any reason, \\nincluding termination and maturity, the remaining unamortized difference between the carrying value of the hedged item at that \\ntime and the face value of the hedged item is amortized to earnings over the remaining life of the hedged item, or immediately \\nif the hedged item has matured or has been extinguished. The total notional values of derivatives that were designated and \\nqualified as fair value hedges of this type were $13,693 million and $13,425 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, \\nrespectively.\\n81\\nThe following table summarizes the pretax impact that changes in the fair values of derivatives designated as fair value hedges \\nhad on earnings (in millions):\\nHedging Instruments and Hedged Items\\nFinancial Statement Line Item Impacted\\nGain (Loss)\\nRecognized in \\nIncome\\n2023\\nInterest rate contracts\\nInterest expense\\n$ \\n609 \\nFixed-rate debt\\nInterest expense\\n \\n(591) \\nNet impact of fair value hedging instruments\\n$ \\n18 \\n2022\\nInterest rate contracts\\nInterest expense\\n$ \\n(1,944) \\nFixed-rate debt\\nInterest expense\\n \\n1,927 \\n Net impact of fair value hedging instruments\\n$ \\n(17) \\n2021\\nInterest rate contracts\\nInterest expense\\n$ \\n(67) \\nFixed-rate debt\\nInterest expense\\n \\n66 \\nNet impact of fair value hedging instruments\\n$ \\n(1) \\nThe following table summarizes the amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheets related to hedged items in fair value \\nhedging relationships (in millions):\\nCumulative Amount of Fair Value Hedging Adjustments1 \\nCarrying Values of \\nHedged Items\\nIncluded in the Carrying Values \\nof Hedged Items\\nRemaining for Which Hedge \\nAccounting Has Been \\nDiscontinued\\nBalance Sheet Location of Hedged Items\\nDecember 31,\\n2023\\nDecember 31,\\n2022\\nDecember 31,\\n2023\\nDecember 31,\\n2022\\nDecember 31,\\n2023\\nDecember 31,\\n2022\\nCurrent maturities of long-term debt\\n$ \\n552 $ \\n— \\n$ \\n1 $ \\n— \\n$ \\n— $ \\n— \\nLong-term debt\\n \\n12,186  \\n11,900 \\n \\n(1,135)  \\n(1,664)  \\n162  \\n195 \\n1 Cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments does not include changes due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\\nIn June 2023, the Company amended the terms of its interest rate swap agreements to implement a forward-looking interest rate \\nbased on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) in place of the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). Since the \\ninterest rate swap agreements were affected by reference rate reform, the Company applied the expedients and exceptions \\nprovided to preserve the past presentation of its derivatives without de-designating the existing hedging relationships. All \\namendments to interest rate swap agreements were executed with the existing counterparties and did not change the notional \\namounts, maturity dates or other critical terms of the hedging relationships.\\nHedges of Net Investments in Foreign Operations Strategy\\nThe Company uses forward contracts and a portion of its foreign currency denominated debt, a non-derivative financial \\ninstrument, to protect the value of our net investments in a number of foreign operations. For derivative financial instruments \\nthat are designated and qualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations, the changes in the fair values of the \\nderivative financial instruments are recognized in net foreign currency translation adjustments, a component of AOCI, to offset \\nthe changes in the values of the net investments being hedged. For non-derivative financial instruments that are designated and \\nqualify as hedges of net investments in foreign operations, the changes in the carrying values of the designated portions of the \\nnon-derivative financial instruments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are recorded in net foreign currency \\ntranslation adjustments. Any ineffective portions of net investment hedges are reclassified from AOCI into earnings during the \\nperiod of change. \\n82\\nThe following table summarizes the notional values and pretax impact of changes in the fair values of instruments designated as \\nnet investment hedges (in millions):\\nNotional Values\\nGain (Loss) Recognized in OCI\\nas of December 31,\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n \\n2023\\n2022\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nForeign currency contracts\\n$ \\n150 $ \\n— \\n$ \\n(6) $ \\n(10) $ \\n(10) \\nForeign currency denominated debt\\n \\n12,437  \\n12,061 \\n \\n(376)  \\n751  \\n928 \\nTotal\\n$ \\n12,587 $ \\n12,061 \\n$ \\n(382) $ \\n741 $ \\n918 \\nThe Company did not reclassify any gains or losses related to net investment hedges from AOCI into earnings during the years \\nended December 31, 2023 and 2022. The Company reclassified a loss of $4 million related to net investment hedges from \\nAOCI into earnings during the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, the Company did not have any ineffectiveness \\nrelated to net investment hedges during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. The cash inflows and outflows \\nassociated with the Company’s derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges are classified in the line item other \\ninvesting activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows.\\nEconomic (Non-Designated) Hedging Strategy\\nIn addition to derivative instruments that have been designated and qualify for hedge accounting, the Company also uses certain \\nderivatives as economic hedges of foreign currency, interest rate and commodity exposure. Although these derivatives were not \\ndesignated and/or did not qualify for hedge accounting, they are effective economic hedges. The changes in the fair values of \\neconomic hedges are immediately recognized in earnings.\\nThe Company uses foreign currency economic hedges to offset the earnings impact that fluctuations in foreign currency \\nexchange rates have on certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies. The changes in the fair \\nvalues of economic hedges used to offset those monetary assets and liabilities are immediately recognized in earnings in the line \\nitem other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income. In addition, we use foreign currency economic hedges \\nto minimize the variability in cash flows associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including those related \\nto certain acquisition and divestiture activities. The changes in the fair values of economic hedges used to offset the variability \\nin U.S. dollar net cash flows are immediately recognized in earnings in the line items net operating revenues, cost of goods sold \\nor other income (loss) — net in our consolidated statement of income, as applicable. The total notional values of derivatives \\nrelated to our foreign currency economic hedges were $6,989 million and $4,902 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, \\nrespectively.\\nThe Company uses interest rate contracts as economic hedges to minimize exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate \\ndebt that result from fluctuations in benchmark interest rates. There were no interest rate contracts used as economic hedges as \\nof December 31, 2023 and 2022. \\nThe Company also uses certain derivatives as economic hedges to mitigate the price risk associated with the purchase of \\nmaterials used in the manufacturing process and vehicle fuel. The changes in the fair values of these economic hedges are \\nimmediately recognized in earnings in the line items net operating revenues, cost of goods sold, or selling, general and \\nadministrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income, as applicable. The total notional values of derivatives related \\nto our economic hedges of this type were $325 million and $336 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\\n83\\nThe following table presents the pretax impact that changes in the fair values of derivatives not designated as hedging \\ninstruments had on earnings (in millions):\\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Financial Statement Line Item Impacted\\nGain (Loss) Recognized in Income\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nForeign currency contracts\\nNet operating revenues\\n$ \\n(74) $ \\n(55) $ \\n6 \\nForeign currency contracts\\nCost of goods sold\\n \\n66  \\n46  \\n(10) \\nForeign currency contracts\\nOther income (loss) — net\\n \\n(10)  \\n57  \\n(84) \\nCommodity contracts\\nCost of goods sold\\n \\n(137)  \\n(40)  \\n171 \\nInterest rate contracts\\nInterest expense\\n \\n—  \\n—  \\n(187) \\nOther derivative instruments\\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\\n \\n5  \\n(21)  \\n34 \\nOther derivative instruments\\nOther income (loss) — net\\n \\n—  \\n—  \\n(3) \\nTotal\\n $ \\n(150) $ \\n(13) $ \\n(73) \\nNOTE 6: EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS \\nOur consolidated net income includes our Company’s proportionate share of the net income or loss of our equity method \\ninvestees.

Refer to Note 2. \\nNOTE 9: SUPPLY CHAIN FINANCE PROGRAM\\nOur current payment terms with the majority of our suppliers are 120 days. Two global financial institutions offer a voluntary \\nsupply chain finance (“SCF”) program, which enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from the \\nCompany to these financial institutions on a non-recourse basis at a rate that leverages our credit rating and thus may be more \\nbeneficial to them. The SCF program is available to suppliers of goods and services included in cost of goods sold and selling, \\ngeneral and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income. The Company and our suppliers agree on \\ncontractual terms for the goods and services we procure, including prices, quantities and payment terms, regardless of whether \\nthe supplier elects to participate in the SCF program. The suppliers sell goods or services, as applicable, to the Company and \\nissue the associated invoices to the Company based on the agreed-upon contractual terms. Then, if they are participating in the \\nSCF program, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, determine which invoices, if any, they want to sell to the financial \\ninstitutions. Our suppliers’ voluntary inclusion of invoices in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms. No \\nguarantees are provided by the Company or any of our subsidiaries under the SCF program. We have no economic interest in a \\nsupplier’s decision to participate in the SCF program, and we have no direct financial relationship with the financial \\ninstitutions, as it relates to the SCF program. Accordingly, amounts due to our suppliers that elected to participate in the SCF \\nprogram are included in the line item accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet. All activity \\nrelated to amounts due to suppliers that elected to participate in the SCF program is reflected within the operating activities \\nsection of our consolidated statement of cash flows. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the amount of obligations outstanding \\nthat the Company has confirmed as valid to the financial institutions under the SCF program was $1,421 million and \\n$1,351 million, respectively.\\nNOTE 10: LEASES \\nWe have operating leases primarily for real estate, manufacturing and other equipment, aircraft and vehicles. \\nBalance sheet information related to operating leases is as follows (in millions):\\nDecember 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\nOperating lease ROU assets1\\n$ \\n1,328 $ \\n1,406 \\nCurrent portion of operating lease liabilities2\\n$ \\n361 $ \\n341 \\nNoncurrent portion of operating lease liabilities3\\n \\n1,001  \\n1,113 \\nTotal operating lease liabilities\\n$ \\n1,362 $ \\n1,454 \\n1 Operating lease ROU assets are included in the line item other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\\n2 The current portion of operating lease liabilities is included in the line item accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated \\nbalance sheets.\\n3 The noncurrent portion of operating lease liabilities is included in the line item other noncurrent liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.\\nWe had operating lease costs of $397 million for both the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.

As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, \\nwe had $4,209 million and $2,146 million, respectively, in outstanding commercial paper borrowings. Our weighted-average \\ninterest rates for commercial paper outstanding were 5.3% and 4.2% as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of \\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company also had $348 million and $227 million, respectively, in lines of credit, short-term \\ncredit facilities and other short-term borrowings that were related to our international operations.\\nIn addition, we had $6,159 million in unused lines of credit and other short-term credit facilities as of December 31, 2023, of \\nwhich $4,550 million was in corporate backup lines of credit for general purposes. These backup lines of credit expire at \\nvarious times through 2028. There were no borrowings under these corporate backup lines of credit during 2023. These credit \\nfacilities are subject to normal banking terms and conditions.

These extinguishments resulted in associated charges of $559 million recorded in the line item interest expense in our \\nconsolidated statement of income. These charges included the difference between the reacquisition price and the net carrying \\nvalue of the notes extinguished, including the impact of the related fair value hedging relationships.

Refer to Note 1 for additional information related to the Company’s maximum exposure \\nto loss due to our involvement with VIEs. Our guarantees are primarily related to third-party customers, bottlers and vendors \\nand arose through the normal course of business. These guarantees have various terms, and none of these guarantees is \\nindividually significant. These amounts represent the maximum potential future payments that we could be required to make \\nunder the guarantees. However, management has concluded that the likelihood of any significant amounts being paid by our \\nCompany under these guarantees is not probable.\\n89\\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\\nWe believe our exposure to concentrations of credit risk is limited due to the diverse geographic areas covered by our \\noperations.\\nLegal Contingencies\\nThe Company is involved in various legal proceedings. We establish reserves for specific legal proceedings when we determine \\nthat the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Management has \\nalso identified certain other legal matters where we believe an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and/or for which no \\nestimate of possible losses can be made. Management believes that the total liabilities of the Company that may arise as a result \\nof currently pending legal proceedings (excluding tax audit claims) will not have a material adverse effect on the Company \\ntaken as a whole.\\nIndemnifications\\nAt the time we acquire or divest an ownership interest in an entity, we sometimes agree to indemnify the seller or buyer for \\nspecific contingent liabilities. Management believes that any liability to the Company that may arise as a result of any such \\nindemnification agreements will not have a material adverse effect on the Company taken as a whole.\\nTax Audits\\nThe Company is involved in various tax matters, with respect to some of which the outcome is uncertain. These uncertain tax \\nmatters may result in the assessment of additional taxes. Refer to Note 15.\\nOn September 17, 2015, the Company received a Statutory Notice of Deficiency (“Notice”) from the United States Internal \\nRevenue Service (“IRS”) seeking approximately $3.3 billion of additional federal income tax for years 2007 through 2009. In \\nthe Notice, the IRS stated its intent to reallocate over $9 billion of income to the U.S. parent company from certain of its \\nforeign affiliates that the U.S. parent company licensed to manufacture, distribute, sell, market and promote its products in \\ncertain non-U.S. markets. \\nThe Notice concerned the Company’s transfer pricing between its U.S. parent company and certain of its foreign affiliates. IRS \\nrules governing transfer pricing require arm’s-length pricing of transactions between related parties such as the Company’s U.S. \\nparent and its foreign affiliates. \\nTo resolve the same transfer pricing issue for the tax years 1987 through 1995, the Company and the IRS had agreed in 1996 on \\nan arm’s-length methodology for determining the amount of U.S. taxable income that the U.S. parent company would report as \\ncompensation from its foreign licensees. The Company and the IRS memorialized this accord in a closing agreement resolving \\nthat dispute (“Closing Agreement”). The Closing Agreement provided that, absent a change in material facts or circumstances \\nor relevant federal tax law, in calculating the Company’s income taxes going forward, the Company would not be assessed \\npenalties by the IRS for using the agreed-upon tax calculation methodology that the Company and the IRS agreed would be \\nused for the 1987 through 1995 tax years. \\nThe IRS audited and confirmed the Company’s compliance with the agreed-upon Closing Agreement methodology in five \\nsuccessive audit cycles for tax years 1996 through 2006. \\nThe September 17, 2015 Notice from the IRS retroactively rejected the previously agreed-upon methodology for the 2007 \\nthrough 2009 tax years in favor of an entirely different methodology, without prior notice to the Company. Using the new tax \\ncalculation methodology, the IRS reallocated over $9 billion of income to the U.S. parent company from its foreign licensees \\nfor tax years 2007 through 2009. Consistent with the Closing Agreement, the IRS did not assert penalties, and it has yet           \\nto do so. \\nThe IRS designated the Company’s matter for litigation on October 15, 2015. Litigation designation is an IRS determination \\nthat forecloses to a company any and all alternative means for resolution of a tax dispute. As a result of the IRS’ designation of \\nthe Company’s matter for litigation, the Company was forced to either accept the IRS’ newly imposed tax assessment and pay \\nthe full amount of the asserted tax or litigate the matter in the federal courts. The matter remains subject to the IRS’ litigation \\ndesignation, preventing the Company from any attempt to settle or otherwise mutually resolve the matter with the IRS.\\nThe Company consequently initiated litigation by filing a petition in the U.S. Tax Court (“Tax Court”) in December 2015, \\nchallenging the tax adjustments enumerated in the Notice. \\nPrior to trial, the IRS increased its transfer pricing adjustment by $385 million, resulting in an additional tax adjustment of \\n$135 million. The Company obtained a summary judgment in its favor on a different matter related to Mexican foreign tax \\ncredits, which thereafter effectively reduced the IRS’ potential tax adjustment by $138 million.\\n90\\nThe trial was held in the Tax Court from March through May 2018, and final post-trial briefs were filed and exchanged in   \\nApril 2019.\\nOn November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued an opinion (“Opinion”) in which it predominantly sided with the IRS but agreed \\nwith the Company that dividends previously paid by the foreign licensees to the U.S. parent company in reliance upon the \\nClosing Agreement should continue to be allowed to offset royalties, including those that would become payable to the \\nCompany in accordance with the Opinion. On November 8, 2023, the Tax Court issued a supplemental opinion (together with \\nthe original Tax Court opinion, “Opinions”), siding with the IRS in concluding both that the blocked-income regulations apply \\nto the Company’s operations and that the Tax Court opinion in 3M Co. & Subs. v. Commissioner (February 9, 2023) controlled \\nas to the validity of those regulations.\\nThe Company believes that the IRS and the Tax Court misinterpreted and misapplied the applicable regulations in reallocating \\nincome earned by the Company’s foreign licensees to increase the Company’s U.S. tax. Moreover, the Company believes that \\nthe retroactive imposition of such tax liability using a calculation methodology different from that previously agreed upon by \\nthe IRS and the Company, and audited by the IRS for over a decade, is unconstitutional. The Company intends to assert its \\nclaims on appeal and vigorously defend its position.\\nIn determining the amount of tax reserve to be recorded as of December 31, 2020, the Company completed the required two-\\nstep evaluation process prescribed by Accounting Standards Codification 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. In doing so, we \\nconsulted with outside advisors, and we reviewed and considered relevant laws, rules, and regulations, including, but not \\nlimited to, the Opinions and relevant caselaw. We also considered our intention to vigorously defend our positions and assert \\nour various well-founded legal claims via every available avenue of appeal. We concluded, based on the technical and legal \\nmerits of the Company’s tax positions, that it is more likely than not the Company’s tax positions will ultimately be sustained \\non appeal. In addition, we considered a number of alternative transfer pricing methodologies, including the methodology \\nasserted by the IRS and affirmed in the Opinions (“Tax Court Methodology”), that could be applied by the courts upon final \\nresolution of the litigation. Based on the required probability analysis, we determined the methodologies we believe the federal \\ncourts could ultimately order to be used in calculating the Company’s tax. As a result of this analysis, we recorded a tax reserve \\nof $438 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the application of the resulting methodologies as well as \\nthe different tax treatment applicable to dividends originally paid to the U.S. parent company by its foreign licensees, in \\nreliance upon the Closing Agreement, that would be recharacterized as royalties in accordance with the Opinions and the \\nCompany’s analysis. \\nThe Company’s conclusion that it is more likely than not the Company’s tax positions will ultimately be sustained on appeal is \\nunchanged as of December 31, 2023. However, we updated our calculation of the methodologies we believe the federal courts \\ncould ultimately order to be used in calculating the Company’s tax. As a result of the application of the required probability \\nanalysis to these updated calculations and the accrual of interest through the current reporting period, we updated our tax \\nreserve as of December 31, 2023 to $439 million.\\nWhile the Company strongly disagrees with the IRS’ positions and the portions of the Opinions affirming such positions, it is \\npossible that some portion or all of the adjustment proposed by the IRS and sustained by the Tax Court could ultimately be \\nupheld. In that event, the Company would likely be subject to significant additional liabilities for tax years 2007 through 2009, \\nand potentially also for subsequent years, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position, \\nresults of operations and cash flows.\\nThe Company calculated the potential impact of applying the Tax Court Methodology to reallocate income from foreign \\nlicensees potentially covered within the scope of the Opinions, assuming such methodology were to be ultimately upheld by the \\ncourts, and the IRS were to decide to apply that methodology to subsequent years, with consent of the federal courts. This \\nimpact would include taxes and interest accrued through December 31, 2023 for the 2007 through 2009 litigated tax years and \\nfor subsequent tax years from 2010 through 2023. The calculations incorporated the estimated impact of correlative adjustments \\nto the previously accrued transition tax payable under the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform Act”). The Company \\nestimates that the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability could be approximately $16 billion as of \\nDecember 31, 2023. Additional income tax and interest would continue to accrue until the time any such potential liability, or \\nportion thereof, were to be paid. We currently project the continued application of the Tax Court Methodology in future years, \\nassuming similar facts and circumstances as of December 31, 2023, would result in an incremental annual tax liability that \\nwould increase the Company’s effective tax rate by approximately 3.5%. \\nThe Company and the IRS are now in the process of agreeing on the tax impacts of the Opinions. Subsequent to the completion \\nof this process, the Tax Court will render a decision in the case. The Company will have 90 days thereafter to file a notice of \\nappeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. The IRS will then seek to collect, and the Company expects to \\npay, any additional tax related to the 2007 through 2009 tax years reflected in the Tax Court decision (and interest thereon). The \\nCompany currently estimates that the payment to be made at that time related to the 2007 through 2009 tax years, which is \\n91\\nincluded in the above estimate of the potential aggregate incremental tax and interest liability, would be approximately \\n$5.8 billion (including interest accrued through December 31, 2023), plus any additional interest accrued through the time of \\npayment. Some or all of this amount, plus accrued interest, would be refunded if the Company were to prevail on appeal. \\nRisk Management Programs\\nThe Company has numerous global insurance programs in place to help protect the Company from the risk of loss. In general, \\nwe are self-insured for large portions of many different types of claims; however, we do use commercial insurance above our \\nself-insured retentions to reduce the Company’s risk of catastrophic loss. Our reserves for the Company’s self-insured losses are \\nestimated using actuarial methods and assumptions of the insurance industry, adjusted for our specific expectations based on \\nour claims history. Our self-insurance reserves totaled $197 million and $199 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, \\nrespectively.\\nNOTE 13: STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS \\nOur Company grants long-term equity awards under its stock-based compensation plans to certain employees of the Company. \\nThe Coca-Cola Company 2014 Equity Plan (“2014 Equity Plan”) was approved by shareowners in April 2014. Under the 2014 \\nEquity Plan, a maximum of 500 million shares of our common stock was approved to be issued through the grant of equity \\nawards. The 2014 Equity Plan allows for grants of stock options, performance share units, restricted stock, restricted stock units \\nand other specified award types, including cash awards with performance-based vesting criteria. As of December 31, 2023, \\nthere were 284 million shares available to be granted under the 2014 Equity Plan. In addition, there were 3 million shares \\navailable for stock option and restricted stock award grants under plans approved by shareowners prior to 2014.\\nTotal stock-based compensation expense was $251 million, $361 million and $337 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, \\nrespectively. In 2022, for certain employees who accepted voluntary separation from the Company as a result of the \\nrestructuring of our North America operating unit, the Company provided cash payments designed to offset the loss of certain \\nequity awards and serve as a cash supplement to the employees upon the exercise of certain stock options. The stock-based \\ncompensation expense in 2022 arising from the estimated cash payments was $5 million and was recorded in the line item other \\noperating charges, and the remaining stock-based compensation expense of $356 million was recorded in the line item selling, \\ngeneral and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income. In 2023, the Company recorded stock-based \\ncompensation expense of $254 million in the line item selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated \\nstatement of income. This was partially offset by $3 million related to the revision of management’s estimates arising from the \\nsettlement of the estimated cash payments recognized in 2022, which was recorded in the line item other operating charges in \\nour consolidated statement of income. Refer to Note 19 for additional information on the Company’s restructuring and strategic \\nrealignment initiatives. All stock-based compensation expense in 2021 was recorded in the line item selling, general and \\nadministrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income. The total income tax benefit recognized in our consolidated \\nstatements of income related to total stock-based compensation expense was $40 million, $55 million and $60 million in 2023, \\n2022 and 2021, respectively. \\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $267 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock-based \\ncompensation awards granted under our plans, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years as \\nstock-based compensation expense. This expected cost does not include the impact of any future stock-based compensation \\nawards.\\n92\\nStock Option Awards\\nStock option awards are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the average of the high and low market prices per \\nshare of the Company’s stock on the grant date. The fair value of each stock option award is estimated using a Black-Scholes-\\nMerton option-pricing model and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is generally four years. \\nThe weighted-average fair value of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 and the \\nweighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model for such grants were as follows:\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nFair value of stock options on grant date\\n$ \\n9.84 \\n$ \\n8.23 \\n$ \\n5.08 \\nDividend yield1\\n 3.0% \\n 2.8% \\n 3.3% \\nExpected volatility2\\n 17.5% \\n 18.0% \\n 18.0% \\nRisk-free interest rate3\\n 4.1% \\n 1.9% \\n 0.9% \\nExpected term of stock options4\\n6 years\\n6 years\\n6 years\\n1 The dividend yield is the calculated yield on the closing market price per share of the Company’s stock on the grant date.\\n2 The expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on the Company’s stock, historical volatility of the Company’s \\nstock and other factors.\\n3 The risk-free interest rate for the period matching the expected term of the stock options is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect \\non the grant date.\\n4 The expected term of the stock options represents the period of time that stock options are expected to be outstanding and is derived by \\nanalyzing historical exercise behavior.\\nStock option awards generally expire 10 years after the grant date. The shares of common stock to be issued and/or sold upon \\nthe exercise of stock options are made available from either authorized and unissued common stock or from treasury shares. \\nSince 2007, the Company has issued common stock under its stock-based compensation plans from treasury shares.\\nStock option activity during the year ended December 31, 2023 was as follows:\\nShares\\n(In millions)\\nWeighted-\\nAverage\\nExercise Price\\nWeighted-\\nAverage\\nRemaining\\nContractual Term\\nAggregate\\nIntrinsic Value\\n(In millions)\\nOutstanding on January 1, 2023\\n \\n59 $ \\n45.93 \\n \\n \\nGranted\\n \\n3  \\n60.05 \\n \\n \\nExercised\\n \\n(14)  \\n39.47 \\n \\n \\nForfeited/expired\\n \\n(1)  \\n55.58 \\n \\n \\nOutstanding on December 31, 2023\\n \\n47 $ \\n48.52 \\n4.7 years $ \\n507 \\nExpected to vest\\n \\n46 $ \\n48.38 \\n4.6 years $ \\n506 \\nExercisable on December 31, 2023\\n \\n36 $ \\n45.55 \\n3.7 years $ \\n483 \\nThe total intrinsic value of the stock options exercised was $268 million, $534 million and $358 million in 2023, 2022 and \\n2021, respectively. The total number of stock options exercised was 14 million, 22 million and 19 million in 2023, 2022 and \\n2021, respectively.\\nPerformance-Based Share Unit Awards\\nPerformance share unit awards require achievement of certain performance criteria, which are predefined by the Talent and \\nCompensation Committee of our Board of Directors at the time of grant. For performance share unit awards granted from 2018 \\nthrough 2022, the performance criteria were equally weighted among net operating revenues, earnings per share and free cash \\nflow over a predefined performance period of three years. For performance share unit awards granted to executives in 2022, and \\nfor performance share unit awards granted to all participants in 2023, the performance criteria were weighted 30% for net \\noperating revenues, 30% for earnings per share, 30% for free cash flow and 10% for environmental sustainability. For purposes \\nof these performance criteria, earnings per share is diluted net income per share; free cash flow is net cash provided by \\noperating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment; and environmental sustainability is comprised of \\npredefined goals related to the Company’s packaging and water security strategies. These performance criteria are adjusted for \\ncertain items, if applicable, which are subject to Audit Committee approval. The purpose of these adjustments is to ensure a \\nconsistent year-to-year comparison of the specific performance criteria. Performance share unit awards granted to executives in \\n2018 through 2022 and performance share unit awards granted to all participants in 2023 include a relative TSR modifier to \\ndetermine the final number of performance share units earned. The fair value of performance share units that include a TSR \\n93\\nmodifier is determined using a Monte Carlo valuation model. For these awards, the number of performance share units earned \\nbased on the certified achievement of the predefined performance criteria will be reduced or increased if the Company’s total \\nshareowner return over the performance period relative to a predefined group of companies falls outside of a predefined range. \\nThe fair value of performance share units that do not include a TSR modifier is the closing market price per share of the \\nCompany’s stock on the grant date less the present value of the expected dividends not received during the performance period. \\nThe performance share unit awards will generally vest at the end of the respective performance period. \\nDuring 2021, in addition to granting performance share unit awards with a three-year performance period, the Company granted \\nemerging stronger performance share unit awards with a predefined performance period of two years. The award’s performance \\ncriterion was earnings per share, and the award included a relative TSR modifier. Earnings per share for these purposes was \\ndiluted net income per share adjusted for certain items, which were approved by the Audit Committee. The purpose of these \\nadjustments was to ensure a consistent year-to-year comparison of the performance criterion. These performance share unit \\nawards generally vested at the end of the two-year performance period.\\nFor performance share unit awards, in the event the certified results equal the predefined performance criteria, the number of \\nperformance share units earned will be equal to the target award. In the event the certified results exceed the predefined \\nperformance criteria, additional performance share units up to the maximum award will be earned. In the event the certified \\nresults fall below the predefined performance criteria but are at or above the minimum threshold, a reduced number of \\nperformance share units will be earned. If the certified results fall below the minimum threshold, no performance share units \\nwill be earned. Performance share unit awards do not entitle participants to vote or receive dividends until the performance \\nshare units are settled in stock. \\nIn the reporting period it becomes probable that the minimum performance threshold specified in the performance share unit \\naward will be achieved, we recognize compensation expense for the proportionate share of the total fair value of the \\nperformance share units related to the vesting period that has already lapsed for the performance share units expected to vest. \\nThe remaining fair value of the performance share units expected to vest is expensed on a straight-line basis over the remainder \\nof the vesting period. In the event the Company determines it is no longer probable that the minimum performance threshold \\nspecified in the award will be achieved, we reverse all previously recognized compensation expense in the reporting period such \\na determination is made.\\nPerformance share units earned are generally settled in stock, except for certain circumstances such as death or disability, in \\nwhich case beneficiaries or employees are provided cash payments. As of December 31, 2023, nonvested performance share \\nunits of approximately 1,567,000 and 1,287,000 were outstanding for the 2022-2024 and 2023-2025 performance periods, \\nrespectively, based on the target award amounts. \\nThe following table summarizes information about outstanding nonvested performance share units based on the target award \\nlevels:\\nPerformance \\nShare Units\\n(In thousands)\\nWeighted-\\nAverage\\nGrant Date\\nFair Value\\nNonvested on January 1, 2023\\n \\n3,706 $ \\n52.94 \\nGranted\\n \\n1,323  \\n56.63 \\nVested1\\n \\n(1,831)  \\n46.65 \\nForfeited\\n \\n(344)  \\n54.65 \\nNonvested on December 31, 20232\\n \\n2,854 $ \\n58.48 \\n1 Represents the target level of performance share units vested as of December 31, 2023 for the 2021-2023 performance period.

Our Company also sponsors postretirement health care and life insurance \\nbenefit plans covering certain U.S. employees. In addition, our Company and its subsidiaries have various pension plans and \\nother forms of postretirement benefit arrangements outside the United States. \\nAs of December 31, 2023, the U.S. qualified pension plan represented 63% and 56% of the Company’s consolidated projected \\nbenefit obligation and pension plan assets, respectively.\\n95\\nObligations and Funded Status\\nThe following table sets forth the changes in the benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our pension and other \\npostretirement benefit plans (in millions):\\nPension Plans\\nOther Postretirement Benefit Plans\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2023\\n2022\\nBenefit obligation at beginning of year1\\n$ \\n6,376 \\n$ \\n8,580 \\n$ \\n495 \\n$ \\n696 \\nService cost\\n \\n94 \\n \\n93 \\n \\n4 \\n \\n7 \\nInterest cost\\n \\n322 \\n \\n232 \\n \\n27 \\n \\n17 \\nParticipant contributions\\n \\n5 \\n \\n5 \\n \\n9 \\n \\n11 \\nForeign currency exchange rate changes\\n \\n27 \\n \\n(152)  \\n(4)  \\n(4) \\nAmendments\\n \\n— \\n \\n9 \\n \\n1 \\n \\n— \\nNet actuarial loss (gain)2\\n \\n375 \\n \\n(1,891)  \\n14 \\n \\n(175) \\nBenefits paid\\n \\n(369)  \\n(500)  \\n(62)  \\n(57) \\nDivestitures\\n \\n— \\n \\n(2)  \\n— \\n \\n— \\nSettlements\\n \\n(287) 3  \\n(26)  \\n(187) 4  \\n— \\nCurtailments\\n \\n— \\n \\n(1)  \\n— \\n \\n— \\nSpecial termination benefits\\n \\n1 \\n \\n1 \\n \\n— \\n \\n— \\nOther\\n \\n— \\n \\n28 \\n \\n— \\n \\n— \\nBenefit obligation at end of year1\\n$ \\n6,544 \\n$ \\n6,376 \\n$ \\n297 \\n$ \\n495 \\nFair value of plan assets at beginning of year\\n$ \\n7,158 \\n$ \\n8,905 \\n$ \\n373 \\n$ \\n419 \\nActual return on plan assets\\n \\n537 \\n \\n(1,101)  \\n17 \\n \\n(55) \\nEmployer contributions\\n \\n44 \\n \\n33 \\n \\n— \\n \\n— \\nParticipant contributions\\n \\n5 \\n \\n5 \\n \\n7 \\n \\n9 \\nForeign currency exchange rate changes\\n \\n76 \\n \\n(258)  \\n— \\n \\n— \\nBenefits paid\\n \\n(300)  \\n(427)  \\n(34)  \\n— \\nSettlements\\n \\n(260) 3  \\n(26)  \\n(187) 4  \\n— \\nOther\\n \\n— \\n \\n27 \\n \\n— \\n \\n— \\nFair value of plan assets at end of year\\n$ \\n7,260 \\n$ \\n7,158 \\n$ \\n176 \\n$ \\n373 \\nNet asset (liability) recognized\\n$ \\n716 \\n$ \\n782 \\n$ \\n(121) $ \\n(122) \\n1 For pension plans, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation. For other postretirement benefit plans, the benefit obligation is \\nthe accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. The accumulated benefit obligation for our pension plans was $6,463 million and \\n$6,307 million as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\\n2 A change in the weighted-average discount rate assumption was the primary driver of net actuarial loss (gain) during 2023 and 2022. For our \\nU.S. qualified pension plan, a decrease in the discount rate resulted in an actuarial loss of $129 million during 2023, and an increase in the \\ndiscount rate resulted in an actuarial gain of $1,231 million during 2022. Additional drivers of net actuarial loss (gain) included other \\nassumption updates and plan experience. \\n3 Settlements primarily related to the U.S. qualified pension plan, which was amended in 2023 to provide lump sum payment options to all \\nformer employees. The U.S. qualified pension plan made $259 million of lump sum payments in 2023, causing a plan settlement, which \\nresulted in recognition of a $76 million settlement charge related to the acceleration of existing unrecognized losses. \\n4 In 2023, the Company settled its U.S. post-65 other postretirement benefit obligations such that retiree reimbursement accounts will be \\nfunded by an insurance company beginning January 1, 2025 for the lifetime of certain retirees and their eligible dependents. The transaction \\nresulted in no change to underlying benefits or plan administration, but only to the future financing of the benefits. Pursuant to the \\nsettlement, the Company transferred $187 million of plan assets and liabilities to an insurer and recognized a $14 million net settlement \\ncredit related to the acceleration of existing unrecognized gains.\\n96\\nPension and other postretirement benefit plan amounts recognized in our consolidated balance sheets were as follows (in \\nmillions):\\nPension Plans\\nOther Postretirement Benefit Plans\\nDecember 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2023\\n2022\\nOther noncurrent assets\\n$ \\n1,543 $ \\n1,558 \\n$ \\n— $ \\n44 \\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\\n \\n(67)  \\n(70)  \\n(4)  \\n(17) \\nOther noncurrent liabilities\\n \\n(760)  \\n(706)  \\n(117)  \\n(149) \\nNet asset (liability) recognized\\n$ \\n716 $ \\n782 \\n$ \\n(121) $ \\n(122) \\nCertain of our pension plans have a projected benefit obligation in excess of the fair value of plan assets.

There are \\na significant number of mutual, pooled and commingled funds from which investors can choose. The selection of the type of fund is dictated \\nby the specific investment objectives and needs of a given plan. These objectives and needs vary greatly between plans.\\n2 Fair value disclosures related to our pension plan assets are included in Note 17. Fair value disclosures include, but are not limited to, the \\nlevels within the fair value hierarchy in which the fair value measurements in their entirety fall; a reconciliation of the beginning and ending \\nbalances of Level 3 assets; and information about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure the fair value of our pension plan \\nassets.\\nInvestment Strategy for U.S. Pension Plan\\nThe Company utilizes the services of investment managers to actively manage the assets of our U.S. qualified pension plan. We \\nhave established asset allocation targets and investment guidelines with each investment manager. Our asset allocation targets \\npromote optimal expected return and volatility characteristics given the long-term time horizon for fulfilling the obligations of \\nthe plan. Selection of the targeted asset allocation for U.S. pension plan assets is based upon a review of the expected return and \\nrisk characteristics of each asset class, as well as the correlation of returns among asset classes. Our target allocation is a mix of \\n18% equity securities, 47% fixed-income securities and 35% alternative investments. We believe this target allocation will \\nenable us to achieve the following long-term investment objectives:\\n(1) optimize the long-term return on plan assets at an acceptable level of risk;\\n(2) maintain a broad diversification across asset classes and among investment managers; and\\n(3) maintain careful control of the risk level within each asset class.\\nThe investment guidelines that have been established with each investment manager provide parameters within which the \\ninvestment managers agree to operate, including criteria that determine eligible and ineligible securities, diversification \\nrequirements and credit quality standards, where applicable. Investment managers agree to obtain written approval for \\ndeviations from stated investment style or guidelines. As of December 31, 2023, no investment manager was responsible for \\nmore than 28% of total U.S. pension plan assets.\\nOur target allocation of 18% equity securities is composed of 81% global equities, 11% emerging market equities and 8% \\ndomestic small-cap and mid-cap equities. Optimal returns through our investments in global equities are achieved through \\nsecurity selection as well as country and sector diversification. As of December 31, 2023, investments in our common stock \\naccounted for 9% of total global equities and 5% of total U.S. pension plan assets. Our investments in global equities are \\nintended to provide diversified exposure to both U.S. and non-U.S. equity markets. Our investments in both emerging market \\nequities and domestic small-cap and mid-cap equities may experience large swings in their market value. Our investments in \\nthese asset classes are selected based on capital appreciation potential.\\nOur target allocation of 47% fixed-income securities is composed of 62% long-duration bonds and 38% with multi-strategy \\nalternative credit managers. Long-duration bonds are intended to provide a stable rate of return through investments in high-\\nquality publicly traded debt securities. Our investments in long-duration bonds are diversified in order to mitigate duration and \\n98\\ncredit exposure. Multi-strategy alternative credit managers invest in a combination of high-yield bonds, bank loans, structured \\ncredit and emerging market debt. These investments are in lower-rated and non-rated debt securities, which generally produce \\nhigher returns compared to long-duration bonds and also help diversify our overall fixed-income portfolio.\\nOur target allocation for alternative investments is 35%. These alternative investments include hedge funds, reinsurance, private \\nequity limited partnerships, leveraged buyout funds, international venture capital partnerships and real estate. The objective of \\ninvesting in alternative investments is to provide a higher rate of return than that which is typically available from publicly \\ntraded equity securities. Alternative investments are inherently illiquid and require a long-term perspective in evaluating \\ninvestment performance.\\nInvestment Strategy for Non-U.S. Pension Plans\\nThe long-term target allocation for 66% of our international subsidiaries’ pension plan assets, primarily certain of our European \\nand Canadian plans, is 60% equity securities, 29% fixed-income securities and 11% other investments. The actual allocation for \\nthe remaining 34% of the Company’s international subsidiaries’ pension plan assets consisted of 40% mutual, pooled and \\ncommingled funds; 23% fixed-income securities; 2% equity securities; and 35% other investments as of December 31, 2023. \\nThe investment strategies for our international subsidiaries’ pension plans vary greatly, and in some instances are influenced by \\nlocal law. None of our pension plans outside the United States is individually significant for separate disclosure.\\nOther Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets\\nPlan assets associated with other postretirement benefits primarily represent funding of one of the U.S. postretirement health \\ncare benefit plans through a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association (“VEBA”), a tax-qualified trust. The VEBA assets \\nare primarily invested in liquid assets due to the level and timing of expected future benefit payments.\\nThe following table presents total assets by asset class for our other postretirement benefit plans (in millions):\\nDecember 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\nCash and cash equivalents\\n$ \\n10 $ \\n43 \\nEquity securities:\\nU.S.-based companies\\n \\n73  \\n133 \\nInternational-based companies\\n \\n4  \\n4 \\nFixed-income securities:\\nGovernment bonds\\n \\n14  \\n12 \\nCorporate bonds and debt securities\\n \\n7  \\n71 \\nMutual, pooled and commingled funds\\n \\n39  \\n86 \\nHedge funds/limited partnerships\\n \\n18  \\n14 \\nReal estate\\n \\n6  \\n6 \\nOther\\n \\n5  \\n4 \\nTotal other postretirement benefit plan assets1\\n$ \\n176 $ \\n373 \\n1 Fair value disclosures related to our other postretirement benefit plan assets are included in Note 17.

The gain/loss corridor is equal to 10% of the greater of the benefit \\nobligation and the market-related value of assets. Gains and losses in excess of the corridor are generally amortized over the average future \\nworking lifetime of the plan participants. \\n3 Settlements primarily related to the U.S. qualified pension plan, which was amended in 2023 to provide lump sum payment options to all \\nformer employees. The U.S. qualified pension plan made $259 million of lump sum payments in 2023, causing a plan settlement, which \\nresulted in recognition of a $76 million settlement charge related to the acceleration of existing unrecognized losses.\\n4 Settlement charges were primarily related to our strategic realignment initiatives. Refer to Note 19.\\n5 In 2023, the Company settled its U.S. post-65 other postretirement benefit obligations such that retiree reimbursement accounts will be \\nfunded by an insurance company beginning January 1, 2025 for the lifetime of certain retirees and their eligible dependents. The transaction \\nresulted in no change to underlying benefits or plan administration, but only to the future financing of the benefits. Pursuant to the \\nsettlement, the Company transferred $187 million of plan assets and liabilities to an insurer and recognized a $14 million net settlement \\ncredit related to the acceleration of existing unrecognized gains.\\nAll of the amounts in the table above, other than service cost, were recorded in the line item other income (loss) — net in our \\nconsolidated statements of income.\\nImpact on Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\\nThe following table sets forth the pretax changes in AOCI for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans (in millions):\\nPension Plans\\nOther Postretirement Benefit Plans\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2023\\n2022\\nBalance in AOCI at beginning of year\\n$ \\n(1,755) $ \\n(2,125) $ \\n95 $ \\n(4) \\nRecognized prior service cost (credit)\\n \\n1  \\n— \\n \\n(3)  \\n(3) \\nRecognized net actuarial loss (gain)\\n \\n177  \\n107 \\n \\n(19)  \\n— \\nPrior service cost occurring during the year\\n \\n—  \\n(9)  \\n(1)  \\n— \\nNet actuarial gain (loss) occurring during the year\\n \\n(313)  \\n232 \\n \\n(12)  \\n104 \\nNet foreign currency translation adjustments\\n \\n(16)  \\n40 \\n \\n1  \\n(2) \\nBalance in AOCI at end of year\\n$ \\n(1,906) $ \\n(1,755) $ \\n61 $ \\n95 \\n100\\nThe following table sets forth the pretax amounts in AOCI for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans (in millions):\\nPension Plans\\nOther Postretirement Benefit Plans\\nDecember 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2023\\n2022\\nPrior service credit (cost)\\n$ \\n(17) $ \\n(17) $ \\n20 $ \\n24 \\nNet actuarial gain (loss)\\n \\n(1,889)  \\n(1,738)  \\n41  \\n71 \\nBalance in AOCI at end of year\\n$ \\n(1,906) $ \\n(1,755) $ \\n61 $ \\n95 \\nAssumptions\\nCertain weighted-average assumptions used in computing the benefit obligations for our pension and other postretirement \\nbenefit plans were as follows:\\nPension Plans\\nOther Postretirement Benefit Plans\\nDecember 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2023\\n2022\\nDiscount rate\\n 5.00% \\n 5.50% \\n 6.25% \\n 6.00% \\nInterest crediting rate\\n 3.75% \\n 4.00% \\nN/A\\nN/A\\nRate of increase in compensation levels\\n 4.00% \\n 3.75% \\nN/A\\nN/A\\nCertain weighted-average assumptions used in computing net periodic benefit cost or income were as follows:\\nPension Plans\\nOther Postretirement Benefit Plans\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nDiscount rate\\n 5.50% \\n 3.00% \\n 2.50% \\n 6.00% \\n 3.25% \\n 2.75% \\nInterest crediting rate\\n 4.00% \\n 3.00% \\n 3.00% \\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nRate of increase in compensation levels\\n 3.75% \\n 3.75% \\n 3.75% \\nN/A\\nN/A\\nN/A\\nExpected long-term rate of return on plan assets\\n 6.75% \\n 7.00% \\n 7.25% \\n 3.75% \\n 4.00% \\n 4.25% \\nThe discount rate assumption used to account for pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflects the rate at which the \\nbenefit obligations could be effectively settled. The discount rate for U.S. and certain non-U.S. plans is determined using a \\nmatching technique whereby the rates of a yield curve, developed from high-quality debt securities, are applied to projected \\nbenefit cash flows to determine the appropriate effective discount rate. For other non-U.S. plans, we base the discount rate \\nassumption on comparable indices within each of the countries. The Company measures the service cost and interest cost \\ncomponents of net periodic benefit cost or income for pension and other postretirement benefit plans by applying the specific \\nspot rates along the yield curve to the plans’ projected benefit cash flows. The rate of compensation increase assumption is \\ndetermined by the Company based upon annual reviews.\\n101\\nThe cash balance interest crediting rate for the U.S. qualified pension plan is based on the yield on six-month U.S. Treasury \\nbills on the last day of September of the previous plan year, plus 150 basis points, with a minimum interest crediting rate of \\n3.80% for all active employees and certain former employees. The Company assumes that the ultimate interest crediting rate is \\n140 basis points lower than the plan’s year-end discount rate and that the current interest crediting rate will converge with the \\nultimate interest crediting rate after a period of 10 years.\\nThe expected long-term rate of return assumption for U.S. pension plan assets is based upon the target asset allocation and is \\ndetermined using forward-looking assumptions in the context of historical returns and volatilities for each asset class, as well as \\ncorrelations among asset classes. We evaluate the expected long-term rate of return assumption on an annual basis. The \\nexpected long-term rate of return assumption used in computing 2023 net periodic benefit income for the U.S. pension plans \\nwas 6.75%. As of December 31, 2023, the 5-year, 10-year and 15-year annualized return for the U.S. pension plan assets was \\n6.7%, 6.1% and 8.3%, respectively. The annualized return since inception was 9.9%.\\nThe weighted-average assumptions for health care cost trend rates were as follows:\\nDecember 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\nHealth care cost trend rate assumed for next year\\n 8.50% \\n 8.25% \\nRate to which the trend rate is assumed to decline (the ultimate trend rate)\\n 6.00% \\n 5.50% \\nYear that the trend rate reaches the ultimate trend rate\\n2029\\n2030\\nWe review external data and our own historical trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rate \\nassumptions. The Company’s U.S. postretirement health care benefits are primarily provided through plans with either a capped \\nCompany cost or a defined-dollar benefit. This limits the effects of health care inflation on the Company.\\nCash Flows\\nThe expected benefit payments for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans for the 10 years succeeding December 31, \\n2023 are as follows (in millions):\\n2024\\n2025\\n2026\\n2027\\n2028\\n2029-2033\\nBenefit payments for pension plans\\n$ \\n654 $ \\n615 $ \\n611 $ \\n614 $ \\n489 $ \\n2,421 \\nBenefit payments for other postretirement\\n   benefit plans\\n \\n49  \\n29  \\n27  \\n24  \\n23  \\n99 \\nTotal\\n$ \\n703 $ \\n644 $ \\n638 $ \\n638 $ \\n512 $ \\n2,520 \\nThe Company anticipates making contributions of approximately $47 million to our pension trusts in 2024, all of which will be \\nallocated to our international plans. These contributions are made in accordance with local laws and tax regulations.\\nDefined Contribution Plans\\nOur Company sponsors qualified defined contribution plans covering substantially all U.S. employees. Under the largest U.S. \\ndefined contribution plan, we match participants’ contributions up to a maximum of 3.0% to 3.5% of compensation, subject to \\nan IRS limit on compensation. The Company’s expense for the U.S. plans totaled $44 million, $45 million and $32 million in \\n2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We also sponsor defined contribution plans in certain locations outside the United States. \\nThe Company’s expense for these plans totaled $82 million in 2023 and $79 million in both 2022 and 2021.\\nMulti-Employer Retirement Plans\\nThe Company participates in various multi-employer retirement plans, which are designed to provide benefits to, or on behalf \\nof, employees of multiple employers. These plans are typically established under collective bargaining agreements. Multi-\\nemployer retirement plans are generally governed by a board of trustees composed of representatives of both management and \\nlabor and are generally funded through employer contributions.\\nThe Company’s expense for multi-employer retirement plans totaled $1 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021. The plans we currently \\nparticipate in have contractual arrangements that extend into 2026. If, in the future, we choose to withdraw from any of the \\nmulti-employer retirement plans in which we currently participate, we would record the appropriate withdrawal liability, if any, \\nat that time.\\n102\\nNOTE 15: INCOME TAXES \\nIncome before income taxes consisted of the following (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nUnited States\\n$ \\n2,766 \\n$ \\n3,452 \\n$ \\n3,538 \\nInternational\\n \\n10,186 \\n \\n8,234 \\n \\n8,887 \\nTotal\\n$ \\n12,952 \\n$ \\n11,686 \\n$ \\n12,425 \\nIncome taxes consisted of the following (in millions):\\nUnited States\\nState and Local\\nInternational\\nTotal\\n2023\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nCurrent\\n$ \\n83 $ \\n129 $ \\n2,039 \\n$ \\n2,251 \\nDeferred\\n \\n(135)  \\n(78)  \\n211 \\n \\n(2) \\n2022\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nCurrent\\n$ \\n468 $ \\n118 $ \\n1,651 \\n$ \\n2,237 \\nDeferred\\n \\n(121)  \\n(4)  \\n3 \\n \\n(122) \\n2021\\n \\n \\n \\n \\nCurrent\\n$ \\n243 $ \\n106 $ \\n1,378 \\n$ \\n1,727 \\nDeferred\\n \\n229  \\n(10)  \\n675 1  \\n894 \\n1 Includes net tax expense of $195 million related to changes in tax laws in certain foreign jurisdictions.\\nWe made income tax payments of $2,580 million, $2,403 million and $2,168 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, \\nwhich included $723 million, $385 million, and $385 million, respectively, of the one-time transition tax required by the Tax \\nReform Act.\\nOur effective tax rate reflects the tax benefits of having significant operations outside the United States, which are generally \\ntaxed at rates lower than the statutory U.S. federal tax rate. As a result of employment actions and capital investments made by \\nthe Company, certain tax jurisdictions provide income tax incentive grants, including Brazil, Costa Rica, Singapore and \\nEswatini. The terms of these grants expire from 2025 to 2036. We anticipate that we will be able to extend or renew the grants \\nin these locations. Tax incentive grants favorably impacted our income tax expense by $332 million, $406 million and \\n$381 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Refer to Note 2.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we have not recorded incremental income taxes for additional outside basis differences of \\n$8.5 billion in our investments in foreign subsidiaries, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign \\n103\\noperations. Determining the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to any additional outside basis differences in \\nthese entities is not practicable.\\nThe Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) provisions of the Tax Reform Act require the Company to include in its \\nU.S. income tax return each foreign subsidiary’s earnings in excess of an allowable return on the foreign subsidiary’s tangible \\nassets. An accounting policy election is available to either account for the tax effects of GILTI in the period that is subject to \\nsuch taxes or to provide deferred taxes for book and tax basis differences that upon reversal may be subject to such taxes. We \\nhave elected to account for the tax effects of these provisions in the period that is subject to such tax and the impact is reflected \\nin our full year provision.\\nThe Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in all applicable jurisdictions, including the U.S. federal jurisdiction, \\nU.S. state jurisdictions and foreign jurisdictions. U.S. tax authorities have completed their federal income tax examinations for \\nall years prior to 2007. With respect to U.S. state jurisdictions and foreign jurisdictions, with limited exceptions, the Company \\nand its subsidiaries are no longer subject to income tax audits for years prior to 2007. For U.S. federal and state tax purposes, \\nthe net operating losses and tax credit carryovers that were acquired in connection with our acquisition of Coca-Cola \\nEnterprises Inc.’s former North America business and that were generated from 1990 through 2010 are subject to adjustments \\nuntil the year in which they are utilized is no longer subject to examination. Although the outcome of tax audits is always \\nuncertain, the Company believes that adequate amounts of tax, including interest and penalties, have been provided for in \\naccordance with the applicable accounting guidance.\\nOn November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued the Opinion regarding the Company’s 2015 litigation with the IRS involving \\ntransfer pricing tax adjustments in which the court predominantly sided with the IRS. On November 8, 2023, the Tax Court \\nissued a supplemental opinion, siding with the IRS in concluding both that the blocked-income regulations apply to the \\nCompany’s operations and that the Tax Court opinion in 3M Co. & Subs. v. Commissioner (February 9, 2023) controlled as to \\nthe validity of those regulations. The Company strongly disagrees with the Opinions and intends to vigorously defend its \\nposition. Refer to Note 12.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $929 million. If the Company were to prevail on \\nall uncertain tax positions, the net effect would be a benefit of $632 million, exclusive of any benefits related to interest and \\npenalties. The remaining $297 million primarily represents tax benefits that would be received in different tax jurisdictions in \\nthe event the Company did not prevail on all uncertain tax positions.\\nA reconciliation of the changes in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nBalance of unrecognized tax benefits at beginning of year\\n$ \\n926 $ \\n906 $ \\n915 \\nIncrease related to prior period tax positions\\n \\n2  \\n6  \\n9 \\nDecrease related to prior period tax positions\\n \\n(25)  \\n—  \\n(50) \\nIncrease related to current period tax positions\\n \\n32  \\n38  \\n37 \\nDecrease related to settlements with taxing authorities\\n \\n—  \\n(2)  \\n(4) \\nDecrease due to lapse of the applicable statute of limitations\\n \\n(2)  \\n—  \\n— \\nEffect of foreign currency translation\\n \\n(4)  \\n(22)  \\n(1) \\nBalance of unrecognized tax benefits at end of year\\n$ \\n929 $ \\n926 $ \\n906 \\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the line item income taxes in our \\nconsolidated statement of income. The Company had $544 million, $496 million and $453 million in interest and penalties \\nrelated to unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Of these amounts, expense \\nof $48 million, $43 million and $62 million was recognized in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. If the Company were to \\nprevail on all uncertain tax positions, the reversal of this accrual would be a benefit to the Company’s effective tax rate.\\nIt is expected that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next 12 months; however, we do not expect any \\nchanges will have a significant impact on our consolidated statement of income or consolidated balance sheet. These changes \\nmay be the result of settlements of ongoing audits, statute of limitations expiring or final settlements in transfer pricing matters \\nthat are the subject of litigation. Currently, an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible outcomes cannot be made.\\n104\\nThe tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities consisted of the \\nfollowing (in millions):\\nDecember 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\nDeferred tax assets:\\n \\n \\nProperty, plant and equipment\\n$ \\n25 $ \\n40 \\nTrademarks and other intangible assets\\n \\n1,414  \\n1,617 \\nEquity method investments (including net foreign currency translation adjustments)\\n \\n239  \\n366 \\nDerivative financial instruments\\n \\n156  \\n207 \\nOther liabilities\\n \\n1,709  \\n1,503 \\nBenefit plans\\n \\n554  \\n522 \\nNet operating loss carryforwards\\n \\n273  \\n248 \\nOther\\n \\n445  \\n530 \\nGross deferred tax assets\\n \\n4,815  \\n5,033 \\nValuation allowances\\n \\n(396)  \\n(424) \\nTotal deferred tax assets\\n$ \\n4,419 $ \\n4,609 \\nDeferred tax liabilities:\\n \\n \\nProperty, plant and equipment\\n$ \\n(748) $ \\n(741) \\nTrademarks and other intangible assets\\n \\n(1,917)  \\n(1,843) \\nEquity method investments (including net foreign currency translation adjustments)\\n \\n(1,633)  \\n(1,632) \\nDerivative financial instruments\\n \\n(282)  \\n(488) \\nOther liabilities\\n \\n(330)  \\n(372) \\nBenefit plans\\n \\n(428)  \\n(490) \\nOther\\n \\n(159)  \\n(211) \\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\\n$ \\n(5,497) $ \\n(5,777) \\nNet deferred tax assets (liabilities)\\n$ \\n(1,078) $ \\n(1,168) \\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had net deferred tax assets of $273 million and $398 million, respectively, located in \\ncountries outside the United States.\\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had $1,705 million of loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income. Loss \\ncarryforwards of $383 million must be utilized within the next five years, and the remainder can be utilized over a period \\ngreater than five years.\\nAn analysis of our deferred tax asset valuation allowances is as follows (in millions):\\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023\\n2022\\n2021\\nBalance at beginning of year\\n$ \\n424 $ \\n401 $ \\n406 \\nAdditions\\n \\n28  \\n47  \\n25 \\nDeductions\\n \\n(56)  \\n(24)  \\n(30) \\nBalance at end of year\\n$ \\n396 $ \\n424 $ \\n401 \\nThe Company’s deferred tax asset valuation allowances are primarily the result of uncertainties regarding the future realization \\nof recorded tax benefits on tax loss carryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards from operations in various jurisdictions \\nand basis differences in certain equity investments. Current evidence does not suggest that we will realize sufficient taxable \\nincome of the appropriate character within the carryforward period to allow us to realize these deferred tax benefits. If we were \\nto identify and implement tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or generate sufficient income of the \\nappropriate character in these jurisdictions in the future, it could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a \\nreduction of income tax expense. The Company believes that it will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax \\nbenefits related to the remaining net deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheet.\\nIn 2023, the Company recognized a net decrease of $28 million in its valuation allowances, primarily due to net decreases in the \\ndeferred tax assets and related valuation allowances on a certain equity method investment, certain excess foreign tax credit \\ncarryforwards and the changes in net operating losses in the normal course of business. \\n105\\nIn 2022, the Company recognized a net increase of $23 million in its valuation allowances. The increase was primarily due to \\nsignificant negative evidence on the utilization of excess foreign tax credits generated in the current year. The increase was also \\ndue to net increases in the deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances on certain equity method investments and the \\nchanges in net operating losses in the normal course of business. \\nIn 2021, the Company recognized a net decrease of $5 million in its valuation allowances.

Additionally, the inputs used to measure fair value are prioritized based on a three-level \\nhierarchy. This hierarchy requires entities to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable \\ninputs. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:\\n• Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\\n• Level 2 — Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1. We value assets and liabilities included in this \\nlevel using dealer and broker quotations, certain pricing models, bid prices, quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities \\nin active markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.\\n• Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value \\nof the assets or liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar \\ntechniques that use significant unobservable inputs.\\n109\\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements\\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP, certain assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. For \\nour Company, the only assets and liabilities that are adjusted to fair value on a recurring basis are investments in equity \\nsecurities with readily determinable fair values, debt securities classified as trading or available-for-sale, derivative financial \\ninstruments and our contingent consideration liability. Additionally, the Company adjusts the carrying value of certain long-\\nterm debt as a result of the Company’s fair value hedging strategy.\\nInvestments in Debt and Equity Securities\\nThe fair values of our investments in debt and equity securities using quoted market prices from daily exchange traded markets \\nare based on the closing price as of the balance sheet date and are classified as Level 1. The fair values of our investments in \\ndebt and equity securities classified as Level 2 are priced using quoted market prices for similar instruments or nonbinding \\nmarket prices that are corroborated by observable market data. Inputs into these valuation techniques include actual trade data, \\nbenchmark yields, broker/dealer quotes and other similar data. These inputs are obtained from quoted market prices, \\nindependent pricing vendors or other sources.\\nDerivative Financial Instruments\\nThe fair values of our futures contracts are primarily determined using quoted contract prices on futures exchange markets. The \\nfair values of these instruments are based on the closing contract prices as of the balance sheet date and are classified as \\nLevel 1.\\nThe fair values of our derivative instruments other than futures are determined using standard valuation models. The significant \\ninputs used in these models are readily available in public markets, or can be derived from observable market transactions, and \\ntherefore have been classified as Level 2. Inputs used in these standard valuation models for derivative instruments other than \\nfutures include the applicable exchange rates, forward rates, interest rates, discount rates and commodity prices. The standard \\nvaluation model for options also uses implied volatility as an additional input. The discount rates are based on the historical \\nU.S. Deposit or U.S. Treasury rates, and the implied volatility specific to options is based on quoted rates from financial \\ninstitutions.\\nIncluded in the fair values of derivative instruments is an adjustment for nonperformance risk. The adjustment is based on \\ncurrent credit default swap (“CDS”) rates applied to each contract, by counterparty. We use our counterparty’s CDS rate when \\nwe are in an asset position and our own CDS rate when we are in a liability position. The adjustment for nonperformance risk \\ndid not have a significant impact on the estimated fair values of our derivative instruments. \\nThe following tables summarize those assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in millions):\\nDecember 31, 2023\\nLevel 1\\nLevel 2\\nLevel 3\\nOther3\\nNetting\\nAdjustment\\n4\\nFair Value\\nMeasurements\\nAssets:\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nEquity securities with readily determinable values1\\n$ 1,727 $ \\n188 $ \\n6 \\n$ \\n85 $ \\n— \\n$ \\n2,006 \\nDebt securities1\\n \\n—  1,172  \\n3 \\n \\n—  \\n— \\n \\n1,175 \\nDerivatives2\\n \\n—  \\n275  \\n— \\n \\n—  \\n(222) 6  \\n53 8\\nTotal assets\\n$ 1,727 $ 1,635 $ \\n9 \\n$ \\n85 $ \\n(222) $ \\n3,234 \\nLiabilities:\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nContingent consideration liability\\n$ \\n— $ \\n— $ 3,017 5 $ \\n— $ \\n— \\n$ \\n3,017 \\nDerivatives2\\n \\n3  1,445  \\n— \\n \\n—  \\n(1,256) 7  \\n192 8\\nTotal liabilities\\n$ \\n3 $ 1,445 $ 3,017 \\n$ \\n— $ \\n(1,256) $ \\n3,209 \\n1 Refer to Note 4 for additional information related to the composition of our equity securities with readily determinable values and debt \\nsecurities.\\n2 Refer to Note 5 for additional information related to the composition of our derivatives portfolio.\\n3 Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been \\ncategorized in the fair value hierarchy but are included to reconcile to the amounts presented in Note 4.\\n4 Amounts represent the impact of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow the Company to settle net positive and negative \\npositions and also cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparties.

Gross \\ntransfers between levels within the hierarchy were not significant for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\\n111\\nNonrecurring Fair Value Measurements\\nIn addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company records assets and liabilities \\nat fair value on a nonrecurring basis as required by U.S. GAAP. Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring \\nbasis as a result of impairment charges or as a result of observable changes in equity securities using the measurement \\nalternative. \\nThe gains and losses on assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are summarized in the following table (in \\nmillions):\\nGains (Losses)\\n \\nYear Ended December 31,\\n2023  \\n2022  \\nImpairment of property, plant and equipment\\n$ \\n(46) 1 $ \\n— \\nOther-than-temporary impairment charges\\n \\n(39) 2  \\n(96) 3\\nImpairment of intangible assets\\n \\n— \\n \\n(57) 4\\nValuation of shares in equity method investee\\n \\n— \\n \\n(24) 5\\nTotal\\n$ \\n(85) $ \\n(177) \\n1 The Company recorded an asset impairment charge of $25 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 related to the discontinuation \\nof certain manufacturing operations in Asia Pacific. Additionally, the Company recorded an asset impairment charge of $21 million during \\nthe year ended December 31, 2023 related to the restructuring of our manufacturing operations in the United States. These charges, which \\nwere calculated based on Level 3 inputs, were primarily driven by management’s best estimate of the potential proceeds from the disposal of \\nthe related assets.\\n2 The Company recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $39 million during the year ended December 31, 2023 related to an \\nequity method investee in Latin America. This impairment charge was derived using Level 3 inputs and was primarily driven by revised \\nprojections of future operating results.\\n3 The Company recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $96 million during the year ended December 31, 2022 related to an \\nequity method investee in Russia. This impairment charge was derived using Level 3 inputs and was primarily driven by revised projections \\nof future operating results.\\n4 During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $57 million related to a trademark in Asia \\nPacific, which was primarily driven by a change in brand strategy resulting in revised projections of future operating results for the \\ntrademark. The fair value of this trademark was derived using discounted cash flow analyses based on Level 3 inputs.\\n5 During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized a net loss of $24 million on assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. \\nThe net loss was recorded as a result of an equity method investee issuing additional shares of its stock. Accordingly, the Company is \\nrequired to treat this type of transaction as if the Company had sold a proportionate share of its investment. This net loss was determined \\nusing Level 2 inputs and primarily resulted from the recognition of cumulative translation losses.\\nFair Value Measurements for Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets\\nThe fair value hierarchy discussed above is not only applicable to assets and liabilities that are included in our consolidated \\nbalance sheet but is also applied to certain other assets that impact our consolidated financial statements. For example, our \\nCompany sponsors a number of pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Assets contributed to these plans by the \\nCompany become the property of the individual plans. Even though the Company no longer has control over these assets, our \\nconsolidated financial statements are impacted by subsequent fair value adjustments to these assets. The actual return on these \\nassets impacts the Company’s future net periodic benefit cost or income as well as amounts recognized in our consolidated \\nbalance sheet. Refer to Note 14. The Company uses the fair value hierarchy to measure the fair value of assets held by our \\npension and other postretirement benefit plans.\\n112\\nPension Plan Assets\\nThe following table summarizes the levels within the fair value hierarchy for our pension plan assets (in millions):\\nDecember 31, 2023\\nDecember 31, 2022\\nLevel 1\\nLevel 2\\nLevel 3\\nOther 1\\nTotal\\nLevel 1\\nLevel 2\\nLevel 3\\nOther 1\\nTotal\\nCash and cash equivalents\\n$ 163 $ 212 \\n$ \\n— \\n$ \\n— \\n$ 375 \\n$ 146 $ 489 \\n$ \\n— \\n$ \\n— \\n$ 635 \\nEquity securities:\\n \\n \\nU.S.-based companies\\n 1,148  \\n— \\n \\n30 \\n \\n— \\n 1,178 \\n 1,157  \\n7 \\n \\n24 \\n \\n— \\n 1,188 \\nInternational-based companies  \\n904  \\n15 \\n \\n2 \\n \\n— \\n \\n921 \\n \\n920  \\n16 \\n \\n3 \\n \\n— \\n \\n939 \\nFixed-income securities:\\nGovernment bonds\\n \\n107  1,279 \\n \\n— \\n \\n— \\n 1,386 \\n \\n91  1,147 \\n \\n— \\n \\n— \\n 1,238 \\nCorporate bonds and debt\\n   securities\\n \\n—  \\n552 \\n \\n27 \\n \\n— \\n \\n579 \\n \\n—  \\n469 \\n \\n30 \\n \\n— \\n \\n499 \\nMutual, pooled and commingled\\n   funds\\n \\n12  \\n257 \\n \\n— \\n \\n509 4  \\n778 \\n \\n35  \\n202 \\n \\n— \\n \\n530 4  \\n767 \\nHedge funds/limited\\n   partnerships\\n \\n—  \\n— \\n \\n— \\n 1,057 5  1,057 \\n \\n—  \\n— \\n \\n— \\n \\n936 5  \\n936 \\nReal estate\\n \\n—  \\n— \\n \\n— \\n \\n376 6  \\n376 \\n \\n—  \\n— \\n \\n— \\n \\n424 6  \\n424 \\nDerivative financial instruments\\n \\n—  \\n33 2  \\n— \\n \\n— \\n \\n33 \\n \\n—  \\n(14) 2  \\n— \\n \\n— \\n \\n(14) \\nOther\\n \\n—  \\n— \\n \\n323 3  \\n254 7  \\n577 \\n \\n—  \\n— \\n \\n300 3  \\n246 7  \\n546 \\nTotal\\n$ 2,334 $ 2,348 \\n$ 382 \\n$ 2,196 \\n$ 7,260 \\n$ 2,349 $ 2,316 \\n$ 357 \\n$ 2,136 \\n$ 7,158 \\n1 Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been \\ncategorized in the fair value hierarchy but are included to reconcile to the amounts presented in Note 14.\\n2 This class of assets includes investments in interest rate contracts, credit contracts and foreign exchange contracts.\\n3 Includes purchased annuity insurance contracts.\\n4 This class of assets includes actively managed emerging markets equity funds and a collective trust fund for qualified plans, invested \\nprimarily in equity securities of companies in developing and emerging markets.

The financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally \\naccepted in the United States appropriate in the circumstances and, accordingly, include certain amounts based on our best \\njudgments and estimates. Financial information in this report is consistent with that in the financial statements.\\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of internal controls and procedures to \\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial \\nstatements. Our internal control system is supported by a program of internal audits and appropriate reviews by management, \\nwritten policies and guidelines, careful selection and training of qualified personnel, and a written Code of Business Conduct \\nadopted by our Company’s Board of Directors, applicable to all officers and employees of our Company and subsidiaries. In \\naddition, our Company’s Board of Directors adopted a written Code of Business Conduct for Non-Employee Directors which \\nreflects the same principles and values as our Code of Business Conduct for officers and employees but focuses on matters of \\nrelevance to non-employee Directors.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements and, even \\nwhen determined to be effective, can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and \\npresentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may \\nbecome inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may \\ndeteriorate.\\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial \\nreporting as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”). \\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. \\nIn making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the \\nTreadway Commission (2013 Framework) (“COSO”) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework. Based on this assessment, \\nmanagement believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, \\n2023.\\nThe Company’s independent auditors, Ernst & Young LLP, a registered public accounting firm, are appointed by the Audit \\nCommittee of our Company’s Board of Directors, subject to ratification by our Company’s shareowners. Ernst & Young LLP \\nhas audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements of The Coca-Cola Company and subsidiaries and the \\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting. The reports of the independent auditors are contained in this report.\\nAudit Committee’s Responsibility\\nThe Audit Committee of our Company’s Board of Directors, composed solely of Directors who are independent in accordance \\nwith the requirements of the New York Stock Exchange listing standards, the Exchange Act, and the Company’s Corporate \\nGovernance Guidelines, meets with the independent auditors, management and internal auditors periodically to discuss internal \\ncontrols along with auditing and financial reporting matters. The Audit Committee reviews with the independent auditors the \\nscope and results of the audit effort. The Audit Committee also meets periodically with the independent auditors and the chief \\ninternal auditor without management present to ensure that the independent auditors and the chief internal auditor have free \\naccess to the Audit Committee. Our Audit Committee’s Report can be found in the Company’s 2024 Proxy Statement.\\n124\\nJames Quincey\\nJohn Murphy\\nChairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive \\nOfficer\\nFebruary 20, 2024\\nPresident and Chief Financial Officer\\nFebruary 20, 2024\\n \\nErin May\\nMark Randazza\\nSenior Vice President and Controller\\nFebruary 20, 2024\\nSenior Vice President, Assistant Controller and Chief \\nAccounting Officer\\nFebruary 20, 2024\\n125\\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\\nTo the Shareowners and the Board of Directors of The Coca-Cola Company\\nOpinion on the Financial Statements \\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Coca-Cola Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of \\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareowners’ equity and cash flows for \\neach of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial \\nstatements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the \\nCompany at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended \\nDecember 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the \\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated \\nFramework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated \\nFebruary 20, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\\nBasis for Opinion\\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the \\nCompany’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be \\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the \\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to \\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits \\nincluded performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and \\nperforming procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and \\ndisclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by \\nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis \\nfor our opinion.\\nCritical Audit Matters\\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were \\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the \\nfinancial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit \\nmatters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating \\nthe critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \\nAccounting for uncertain tax positions\\nDescription of \\nthe Matter\\nAs described in Note 12 and Note 15 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements, the Company is involved in \\nvarious income tax matters for which the ultimate outcomes are uncertain. As of December 31, 2023, the gross amount of \\nunrecognized tax benefits was $929 million. As described in Note 12, on September 17, 2015 the Company received a \\nStatutory Notice of Deficiency from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for the tax years 2007 through 2009 in the \\namount of $3.3 billion for the period. On November 18, 2020, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion predominantly siding \\nwith the IRS related to the Company’s transfer pricing between its U.S. parent company and certain of its foreign affiliates \\nfor tax years 2007 through 2009. On November 8, 2023, the U.S. Tax Court issued a supplemental opinion, siding with the \\nIRS.\\nWhile the Company continues to disagree with the IRS positions and the portions of the opinion affirming such positions, it \\nis possible that some portion or all of the adjustment proposed by the IRS could ultimately be upheld. As a result of the \\napplication of ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes, the Company has recorded a tax reserve of $439 million for this \\nmatter as of December 31, 2023. \\nAuditing management’s evaluation of uncertain tax positions, including the uncertain tax position associated with the IRS \\nnotice and opinion, was especially challenging due to the level of subjectivity and significant judgment associated with the \\nrecognition and measurement of the tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained. \\n126\\nHow We \\nAddressed the \\nMatter in Our \\nAudit\\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the effectiveness of controls over the Company’s \\naccounting process for uncertain tax positions. Our procedures included testing controls addressing the completeness of \\nuncertain tax positions, controls relating to the identification and recognition of the uncertain tax positions, controls over \\nthe measurement of the unrecognized tax benefit, and controls over the identification of developments related to existing \\nuncertain tax positions. \\nOur audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the assumptions the Company used to assess its uncertain tax \\npositions and related unrecognized tax benefit amounts by jurisdiction. We also tested the completeness and accuracy of \\nthe underlying data used in the identification and measurement of uncertain tax positions. We evaluated evidence of \\nmanagement’s assessment of the opinion, including inquiries of tax counsel, inspection of technical memos, and written \\nrepresentations of management. We involved professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in our evaluation \\nof the tax technical merits of the Company’s assessment, including the assessment of whether the tax positions are more \\nlikely than not to be sustained, the amount of the potential benefits to be realized, and the application of relevant tax law. \\nWe also assessed the Company’s disclosures of uncertain tax positions included in Note 12 and Note 15.\\nValuation of trademarks with indefinite lives and goodwill\\nDescription of \\nthe Matter\\nAs described in Note 1 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements, the Company performs an annual impairment \\ntest of its indefinite-lived intangible assets, including trademarks with indefinite lives and goodwill, or more frequently if \\nevents or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired. Each impairment test may be qualitative or quantitative. \\nTrademarks with indefinite lives and goodwill were $14.3 billion and $18.4 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2023.\\nAuditing the valuation of trademarks with indefinite lives and reporting units with goodwill involved complex judgment \\ndue to the significant estimation required in determining the fair value of the trademarks with indefinite lives and related \\nreporting units with goodwill, respectively. Specifically, the fair value estimates were sensitive to significant assumptions \\nabout future market and economic conditions. Significant assumptions used in the Company’s fair value estimates included \\nsales volume, pricing, royalty rates, long-term growth rates, and discount rates, as applicable. \\nHow We \\nAddressed the \\nMatter in Our \\nAudit\\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s \\nannual impairment tests for trademarks with indefinite lives and reporting units with goodwill. For example, we tested \\nmanagement’s risk assessment process to determine whether to perform a quantitative or qualitative test and management’s \\nreview controls over the valuation models and underlying assumptions used to develop such estimates. For impairment \\ntests of reporting units with goodwill, we also tested controls over the determination of the carrying value of the reporting \\nunits. We tested the estimated fair values of the trademarks with indefinite lives and reporting units with goodwill based on \\nour risk assessments. \\nOur audit procedures included, among others, comparing significant judgmental inputs to observable third party and \\nindustry sources, considering other observable market transactions, and evaluating the reasonableness of management’s \\nprojected financial information by comparing to third party industry projections, third party economic growth projections, \\nand other internal and external data. We performed sensitivity analyses of certain significant assumptions to evaluate the \\nchange in the fair value of the trademarks with indefinite lives and reporting units with goodwill and also assessed the \\nhistorical accuracy of management’s estimates. In addition, we involved specialists to assist in our evaluation of certain \\nsignificant assumptions used in the Company’s discounted cash flow analyses. We also assessed the Company’s disclosure \\nof its annual impairment tests included in Note 1.\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP                                                                                                                           \\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1921.\\nAtlanta, Georgia\\nFebruary 20, 2024\\n127\\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\\nTo the Shareowners and the Board of Directors of The Coca-Cola Company\\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \\nWe have audited The Coca-Cola Company and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of  December 31, 2023, based on \\ncriteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway \\nCommission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, The Coca-Cola Company and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in \\nall material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the \\nconsolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, \\ncomprehensive income, shareowners' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the \\nrelated notes and our report dated February 20, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\\nBasis for Opinion\\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the \\neffectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over \\nFinancial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. \\nWe are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance \\nwith the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain \\nreasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, \\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other \\nprocedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of \\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting \\nprinciples. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of \\nrecords that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide \\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally \\naccepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of \\nmanagement and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized \\nacquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any \\nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or \\nthat the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP                                                                                                                     \\nAtlanta, Georgia\\nFebruary 20, 2024\\n128\\nITEM 9.
