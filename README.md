# RAG_using_Lllamindex using various reterivers and Query engine pipelines . 
Implementation of RAG Systems  and evaluate the performance.

This repository contains the implementation of a precise and scalable Question Answering (QA) system designed to extract information from The Coca-Cola Company's 10-K filings over the last decade. It leverages LlamaIndex, various retriever architectures, and reranking mechanisms to enable natural language querying over financial documents.

📂 Dataset Source:
The Coca-Cola Company Annual Filings (10-K)

📌 Objectives

Load and preprocess 10-K filings using LlamaParser.
Compare the effectiveness of various retrieval mechanisms.
Apply reranking to improve answer precision.
Configure advanced query engine pipelines.
Conduct a thorough evaluation of QA system performance.
