This can be done in one of two ways:  either by including the nominee's name directly within the policy document itself, or by making a separate endorsement to the policy, communicating it to the insurer, and having the insurer register it in their records.  Any such nomination can be canceled or changed at any time before the policy matures, either via a further endorsement, a new will, or other written notice.  Crucially, the insurer is only liable for payments made to the nominee listed in the policy document or officially registered in their records; unless the insurer receives written notice of a cancellation or change, they are not liable for payments made to a previous, unregistered nominee.\n",
